### **What is a Proxy server?**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2054" src="/assets/IP-Address-01.png" alt="PROXY SERVER" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A <a href="/blog/how-to-use-google-as-proxy-server/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proxy Server</a> is an intermediary which is used for communication between two computers. Web Proxy is a server which acquires information from the source server and provides it to the website \[using the proxy server] which wants the information. A proxy is anything that replaces the original one. For example, when actors in films or serials are absent due to any problem or illness then proxy artists are used to replace them. A Proxy server acts as a link between the user’s PC and the source PC’s network \[or blocked website needs to be accessed]. Proxy server hides the internet user’s real identity online. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Users connect the computer to a proxy server and then look up blocked websites. Because the <a href="/blog/how-to-open-blocked-websites-by-proxy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blocked website</a> doesn’t know to whom it is sending the information to. The proxy server completes the total process and doesn’t let the blocked website know.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before configuring the PS4 with the proxy server it is important to know the reasons behind using proxy servers. </span>

### **The need for proxy servers**<span style="font-weight: 400;">:-</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now Playstations can also be played by using proxy servers as they have a lot of advantages. </span>

* #### **It helps towards slow lagging internet speed.**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2050" src="/assets/IP-Address-02.png" alt="SLOW LAGGING INTERNET SPEED" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">PS4 or any Playstation is specially designed to play games and have the best gaming experience. Therefore, the primary requirement to have a world-class gaming experience is a smooth and uninterrupted internet connection. It is very irritating when a gamer loses <a href="/blog/how-to-speed-up-your-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet connection</a> or faces lags in connections during very interesting and exciting situations of the game. But if a PS4 gamer also uses a proxy server as a PC gamer then he will not have to worry about lags and connection losses. The proxy server will be the channel between the user’s PS console and the gaming server and ensures that non-stop internet connection is being provided. This, in turn, provides unhindered <a href="/blog/spice-up-your-game-using-gaming-proxies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming</a> experience.</span>

* #### **Special gaming proxy servers provide a great uptime for enhanced gaming experiences**<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Uptime basically means the number of hours the proxy server was working from the providing centre without any malfunction represented in percentage.  Good gaming proxy servers provide 99.998% uptime. So gamers will not have to pause gaming sessions due to a good uptime. Normal servers don’t have good uptime so game updates need to be paused. Therefore, proxy servers need to be used in order to get a good game play.</span>

* #### **Proxy servers also provide a very fast internet connection**<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2051" src="/assets/IP-Address-04-1.png" alt="VERY FAST INTERNET CONNECTION" width="720" height="361" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The source server from which the internet connection is being taken has a huge speed to give games the ultimate game play. Some gaming servers provide speed up to 1GBps that will make playing games more exciting.</span>

* #### **Proxy servers provide a lot of locations for players**<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many games which hold competitions or worldwide matches in different countries. Sometimes gamers are unable to participate due to different problems. But using proxy servers you can setup any place in any country as your location and play there. In this way, you can participate in any competition. Also, there are <a href="/blog/am-i-a-target-for-online-price-discrimination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online</a> gamers all around the world and using proxy server a gamer can play with any gamer friend from any part of the world. Often it is seen that normal gaming servers divide gaming zones but Proxy servers will take a gamer to any part of the world even outside his gaming zone.  </span>

* #### **Blocked gaming sites can be accessed easily using proxy servers**<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Proxy servers will not let the gaming server know who is visiting their site and who wants to collect the information from their site. Hence, instead of a normal server or Internet Service Provider if a proxy server is used then the blocked site will allow the user to access the site.</span>

* #### **In proxy servers the IP address is kept hidden**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2052" src="/assets/IP-Address-05.png" alt="IP ADDRESS IS KEPT HIDDEN" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So there will be anonymity provided to the gamer. And no one online will be able to trace the user and hence he will be hidden from other gamers. This provides complete secrecy to the gamer. By being anonymous and hidden one will be safe from any kind of threats online. Cases have been reported in the recent past where <a href="/blog/rotate-ip-address/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP addresses</a> have been used to track the person and his identity is stolen and even personal information and online accounts have been hacked. Moreover, gamers can also play games in places where play games of accessing such sites are banned.</span>

* <span style="font-weight: 400;">Proxy servers provide P2P or peer to peer facility which is required for fast torrent downloads. P2P is such a facility where two computers help each other to download web contents like games or game updates faster than normal speed. Most of the proxy server providers have this facility and users must choose them.</span>

So it is important to learn the process to configure Proxy servers for PS4. Once users follow these easy steps then there wouldn’t be any problem at all</span>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">To set up a proxy server for PS4 the steps to be followed are</span>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">1. To set up proxy server users need to find the IP address of the PC or Mobile or Mac device from which the internet connection is being used.</span>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">a. To find the IP address, first of all, open the PC. </span>

          <li style="font-weight: 400;">
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Note down the IP address because it will be used later.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">b. To find the IP address on a Mobile Device</span>
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li style="font-weight: 400;">
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter the settings icon in the Mobile Phone.</span>
          </li>
          <li style="font-weight: 400;">

          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>

          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Now comes the main and important part of assigning the proxy server in the PS4.</span>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Turn on the PS4 console. </span>

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a protocol of the network management system where the DHCP assigns IP address dynamically along with other network parameters to devices connected to the network. </span>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">g. Then set the <a href="/blog/choosing-the-best-domain-name-for-optimum-brand-awareness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Domain Name</a> system as automatic.</span>
        </p>

          <span style="font-weight: 400;">j. Inside the page of Proxy Server, write the IP address of the PC \[that has been noted down earlier] and the Port number of the Proxy Server that the user wants to set. Usually, the Port number is 6588 for windows and 8080 for Mac.</span>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">k. After entering the IP address and Port number, click on “Next”.</span>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">j. At last, test the internet connection and it must be running completely fine.</span>
        </p>
