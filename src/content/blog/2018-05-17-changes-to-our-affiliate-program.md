The <u>LimeProxies</u> Affiliate Program has been wildly successful since its launch, helping LimeProxies grow as a business and rewarding our supporters for promoting and selling our proxies to brand new customers all over the world. Thank you to every one of our affiliates for helping us grow as a business.

However, with the recent affiliate survery and the feedback collected, the LimeProxies team has decided to create a change in the way the Affiliate Program works in order to improve the speed and quality of processing rewards for affiliates.

We have decided to move to a new affiliate system. Please register again for your new account and use the **updated referral links**

<https://limeproxiesonline.tapfiliate.com/programs/limeproxies/signup/>

Please migrate to the new referral links as early as possible.

By moving to the new system, we are introducing a series of new features

  1. All commissions will be **50%**. This includes existing 1st tier commissions of 20%.
  2. Affiliate cookies will last 1 year instead of the previous 45 days.
  3. All affiliates will be paid once a month, on the 5th of every month.
  4. The minimum payout will be $30.00 for US affiliates and $50.00 for affiliates not based in the US.
  5. Payouts can now be requested through paypal/payoneer/bitcoin and bank wire.
  6. Bank wire payouts require a minimum of 1000$

All of these changes will be effective on **May 17th, 2018**.

Note that existing affiliates are NOT automatically enrolled in the new [affiliate program][1].  So kindly register in the above link.

**Access to the existing affiliate portal is currently suspended however all tracking data continues to work smooth, however migrate to the new system asap.**

All customers are welcome to promote LimeProxies and be rewarded for their efforts. To start, login to your <u>[Affiliates Area ][1]</u>and grab your tracking URLs in the Affiliate section.

We look forward to constantly improving the quality of the LimeProxies experience for everyone!

**For any queries or questions, please reach out to our new dedicated affiliates desk on affiliates@limeproxies.com**
