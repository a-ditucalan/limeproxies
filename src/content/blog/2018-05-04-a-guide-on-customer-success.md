## **1. What is Customer Success?**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1496" src="/assets/What-is-Customer-Success_.png" alt="CUSTOMER SUCCESS" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing a concise definition of Customer Success would be risky for many companies. This is such a broad subject that if we try to fit it in a small frame, then it may cause negative implications for some organizations. In our journey to customer success, we will discuss every aspect of it. In this article, we will use essential concepts from many renowned experts and discuss the importance of Customer Success.</span>

#### Customer Success Definition

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the statement of Lincoln Murphy, Customer success is the positive outcome of a satisfied customer when he/she interacted with your company.  A customer always has a specific desire regarding the result of your product and services. Customer Success is achieved when you successfully fulfilled the desire of your customer with your quality service and user experience. Murphy doesn’t put all emphasis on customer success as the main priority, but he refers to all the interactions a customer has with the <a href="/blog/how-to-skyrocket-social-media-marketing-efforts-with-proxies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketing</a>, sales and other team members of the company. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron Ross and Jason Lemkin did not agree to the above point. According to them, the market has changed. The initial purchases experience of a product by the customer serves no longer the real journey of customer success. However, they suggested an alternative hourglass shaped model. The model states that a vital portion of revenue resides in adoption, retention, expansion, and advocacy. </span>

#### Buyer to Customer Journey

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the theory of Murphy, Lemkin, and Ross, customer success is not only meant for SaaS companies. Any company, be it B2B, B2C, product or Service based, can achieve great success, if it helps its users to achieve their desired outcomes. Existing satisfied customers play a significant role in revenue generation for the company through upselling, cross-selling and referrals. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, compared to companies from other field, SaaS companies should focus more on Customer Success. SaaS companies run on the subscription-based business model. A SaaS company should always be alert to their customers. A customer can cancel his/her membership at any point in time and move to a new service provider. As a business owner, you must keep your eyes and ears open. It is crucial that you work on the misunderstandings that might trigger your customers to move away. </span>

### Why is Customer Success Important?

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this subscription-based world, customer success can either make a SaaS company or break it. All SaaS companies should make customer success their core operating philosophy. A well-executed customer success will lead to higher customer lifetime value(CLTV), negative churn and Maximized growth, which in return will create a smooth customer success journey.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The journey of customer success adapted a lot from the hourglass pipeline from Ross and Lemkin. However, when it comes to transitioning a customer through the buyer and execute a customer success journey, the companies consider a different perspective rather than following Ross and Lemkin’s. </span>

### Primary Role of Customer Success

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every customer is different. You can expect the same level of satisfaction from every customer. While one customer might benefit from the Saas application and the others may not. So, you may focus on those buyers who have potential to benefit from your products and services. At the same time, it is better to move away from bad-fit customers before receiving any negative word of mouth.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the buyer journey, a customer success can help you a lot. It also assists you in increasing your revenue by increasing sales. The best way to generate revenue is to create an ideal customer profile or ICP and assign characteristics to it. Some components, which you can include, are revenue, region, vertical, employee headcount, <a href="/blog/internet-things-technology-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technology</a> and size of customer base. With using these characteristics, you can filter out those companies that perfectly fit for your solution in your journey for customer success.</span>

#### Role in Onboarding & Adoption

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the customer success process, onboarding plays the most strategic part. In this phase, a buyer tries to interact with your company as a customer. In most cases, the buyer wants to reap the benefits of the service that your provides. A customer success journey cannot be achieved without a stable adoption phase. Try to make a good impression that will result in retaining your customer as a subscriber. You can also use an innovative online service, <a href="https://fully-verified.com/">often used for video onboarding</a>. It works fast and simply, with high-quality protection from fraud. A satisfied customer in return will try new services and give good feedback about you to their friends and colleagues. Try to avoid a bad reputation, as it will only lead to churn and tarnish your business status. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">WIth onboarding intelligently and prioritizing faster wins, your customer success team must minimize the time-to-value for new clients. To start this, first, you have to figure out how your products could be beneficial for your new clients. After that, develop new milestones for success. The new milestones will assist you in striking the right chord between high tech and high touch engagement points and provide support accordingly. High tech includes engagement points includes guided tours, targeted help, feature callouts, etc. High touch engagement comprises kickoff calls, end-user training, onboarding sessions, etc.  </span>

#### Role in Driving Retention

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your revenue growth can face a drastic impact with a slight difference in churn rate. Retaining a customer is far less expensive than acquiring a new customer. An existing customer is someone who has already integrated your product with his or her business processes and has a fair idea about the value your offer. Retaining existing customers is always a challenge, as your competitors will always try to lure your customers away by enticing them with lucrative solutions. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to stay prompt and proactive regarding the needs of your customer. Rather than waiting for feedback from your clients, it’s better to monitor the progress of your clients. Figure out if the new update is working fine. Enquire your clients about their satisfaction level with the new function. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to detect all the small and significant symptoms of churn and take necessary actions. It’s crucial that you have to drill down to the level of your user and analyze the interactions of your customer, with your products. </span>

#### Role in Driving Expansion

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A satisfied customer is always hungry for more. A satisfied customer will more like to upgrade its subscription for additional advantages such as additional licenses, functionality or seats. When the business of your client starts to grow, he/she will try to purchase complimentary features or services. Now, facilitating the additional needs of your customer is your primary objective. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Establishing an ideal customer success team is necessary. A Customer Success team have a deep understanding of the needs of each user. They assist each user by recommending them the products or features, which will benefit the user the most. Relying on the intelligence of the user, the Customer Success Teams or CS teams act as trusted advisors and make relevant recommendations to formulate the right expansion package. </span>

#### Role in Driving Advocacy

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If a customer managed to enjoy a spectacular experience with your product, then it is more likely that he/she will recommend his friends and colleagues about your service. You have to keep in mind that, each interaction with your customer is an opportunity to create an advocate. With proper communication with your client, you can generate high-quality leads for your business. </span>

### The Customer Success Life Cycle

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A streamlined customer success process can offer two types of effects on your business. The first effect will stabilize your sales pipeline. The CS process will allow you to avoid bad-fit customers and you can target best-fit customers more who have highest expected CLTV. As you filter out all bad-fit buyers at an early stage, it will become easier to study the journey of your customer success program. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you combine your customer success life cycle with the best-fit customer base, it will help you to generate more revenue for your business. When your customers are benefitted from your logical expansion, onboarding, and need-driven product iteration, they will most likely provide high-quality referrals for your business. </span>

### 3 Misconceptions about Customer Success

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, all SaaS and non-SaaS organizations are practicing Customer Success programs. What most organizations do not follow is that CS is a continuous process. It is wrong to assume that CS is some silver bullet, which can be, utilize once to rectify all customer related issues in one go. To set a business apart from competitors, companies must focus on releasing the full power of CS. While short-term CS can satisfy the need of customers at an initial stage, but it fixes the issues on a long-term basis. </span>

#### Here are the top three misconceptions about Customer Success:

#### **1. Only one department is required for Customer Success**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no doubt that every business should follow customer success. When it comes to housing and reporting customer success, it became debatable. Will it be ideal to report the customer success data to Sales or <a href="/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-instagram-influencer-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketing</a>? Some report CS directly to the CEO while other suggest reporting to the Chief customer or Experience officer. According to most SaaS companies, CS is processed to manage the relationship with existing and new users. No matter which method companies choose, it is impossible for CS specialists to satisfy customers on a daily basis if the rest of the workforces does not involve themselves in the CS process. For example, the marketing and sales team must focus on attracting best-fit customers while the product team works with CS team to develop the features according to the demand of customers. </span>

#### 2. Customer Success = Customer Support

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This statement may not be entirely incorrect as CS teams are responsible for supporting users as well as cross-selling and upselling products to the users. The primary function of a traditional support team is to attend the issues of a customer. In traditional support, the team focuses on the problems after it takes place. However, a CS team focus on anticipating the issues beforehand and make sure such issues never happen again in future. In traditional support, the team focuses on selling their products to a customer without realizing the need of the user. A CS specialist performs in-depth investigation regarding the customer needs and then recommend appropriate upgrades and adjacent solutions. </span>

#### 3. Only NPS and Customer Satisfaction Surveys are the only requirements for a Customer Success team

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no doubt that NPS and Customer Satisfaction Surveys provide valuable information about customer’s feedback about your product. However, if you use only a limited approach towards customer success, then your customer success team will soon become blindsided.  To identify accurate insight of a survey’s question, you have to an in-depth analysis of the matter. With a survey-only tool, you can only measure a specific answer to all your survey segments. What it lacks is to monitor the behavior and interactions of different segments. It also does not show the trends and correlations of the segments.</span>

## 2. Developing a Customer Success Strategy

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1497" src="/assets/Developing-a-Customer-Success-Strategy.png" alt="DEVELOPING A CUSTOMER SUCCESS STRATEGY" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After considering the effectiveness of Customer success and figuring out why it matters, you must be thinking about how to plan a suitable approach to establish and execute a customer success strategy. Every SaaS business requires a different approach based on its business model, stage of growth, customer base, size of operation and budget. Still, you can use some elements to build the foundation of you CS Strategy. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we have designed a 6 step CS Strategy which is readily adaptable and applicable to your business. Building a well-tuned and aligned customer success plan according to your company mission will be your first step. The next steps will put more emphasis on developing a success roadmap that analyzes the valuable segment of your business and indicates the results at each milestone. </span>

#### Step 1: Define customer success objectives

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This step includes the necessary decision you must take with each segment. Even though your customer retention numbers may dive, it’s crucial that you let go your bad-fit customers or at least put them in low-maintenance accounts. You can guide your bad-fit customers to choose any other products or subscription plans with high-tech engagement points. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Best-fit customers are those customers who have benefited from your product in the past. In your path towards customer success, you must put all your best-fit customers by analyzing correctly. According to the theory of Murphy, best-fit customers (Also known as vectors) can be divided into three categories. </span>

* #### **   Negative Vector:**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of product training or improper onboarding experience is some of the leading cause of a negative vector. If not taken proper action then there is a high probability that a negative vector is going to cancel his/her subscription. As a company, you must focus on keeping your negative vector out of the churn danger zone within an average period of three months. </span>

* #### **   Neutral Vector:**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A neutral vector is that client who might be happy with your service but doesn’t have the intention to renew its subscription from you. To convert a neutral vector into a positive vector, you have to try your level best to convince him/her within six months. </span>

* #### **   Positive Vector:**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A positive vector is always ready for logical upgrades. Moreover, a positive vector welcomes cross-selling and will happy to recommend your service to her/his friends. You must focus on maximizing your annual revenue with a positive vector along with increasing your quality referrals. </span>

#### Step 2: Establish customer success metrics

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s talk about the process of measuring customer success. Using absolute numbers, you can get a sense of the increase or decrease in customer success metrics such as total number of issues, number of users and revenue. However, with percentages and ratios, you can understand the relationship between different aspects of CS such as its efficiency and effectiveness. Using data from both the category can result in an overall consideration and comparative performance. It will also assist in evaluating the versions of product and growth of customers. </span>

#### Step 3: Link company culture and mission

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While formulating customer success, your primary aim should be to escalate your customer success plan on a continuous basis. That can only be achieved by taking your company’s culture, missions, and foundations into account. So before jumping into Customer Success strategy, make sure all your department are customer-centric. If you find any gap, then try to fix that gap and ensure all your department centers around customer success. </span>

#### Step 4: Ensure alignment and accountability

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to an understanding and implementing customer success, it is essential that all department heads and their staff shares an equal knowledge of Customer Success. Demonstrating direction support from C-Suite is a faster way to realize all your employees about the importance of CS. With C—suite, you can deliver your message about CS to your employees and distribute specific Customer Success tasks to each team. Then your team who interacts with customers can further assist you in providing performance measuring data. </span>

#### Step 5: Develop your blueprint

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This step will help you to figure out enough information about your target customers. You can use that information to find out the way to move your customers from one stage to another customer success journey. With proper analyzing skill, you can also find out the decision-making points of your customers. </span>

##### **Some essential questions worth finding answers for are:**

</li>

#### 

#### Step 6: Segment wisely

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After finding the correct answers from the previous stage, you can easily define your segments along with detecting the difference between best-fit and bad-fit customers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the reason that makes an organization a bad-fit organization for you?</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <strong>If there is an Organizational Misalignment</strong>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <strong>If the organization changes its Product Focus</strong>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <strong>If the organization put poor efforts in sales and marketing</strong>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <strong>If they are draining, many of your resources while providing less ROI</strong>
</li>

  <strong>If their potential for success is little to nothing</strong>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <strong>If you are not able to satisfy them, as they cannot adopt 100% of your product</strong>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What to measure: Percentage of users who scores below 6.    </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Target: To keep detractors below 15%. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Various studies have confirmed that any company that possesses a high NPS can outdo its competitors by a factor of more than 2. Studies also state that, in a successful company, the average CLTV of promoters are supposed to be eight times higher than the detractors do. As a reason, a customer success team conduct NPS Surveys to gather relevant data regarding customer sentiments. The survey helps the CS team to identify those users who can be approached for upselling and cross-selling opportunities. Moreover, it also helps in opting out those customers who do not follow the company’s optimal customer success path. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The in-app method is the best way to execute an NPS Survey as it leads to high rate of engagement. As the in-app method is a “Zero moment of truth” method, the response of users is expected to be more. You can also tailor your survey accordingly to measure a particular aspect of customer experience. For example, you can add a comment section to gather additional feedback after a user uses a new feature or complete the onboarding process.</span>
