<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Trends</span>](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/windows-8-vs-windows-10/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, Windows 8 and <a href="/blog/digital-marketers-using-windows-10-increase-efficiency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows 10</a> are two of the most intricately coded operating systems. They have a number of features that require a lot of system resources counteracted by the latency iteration of Windows 10. It also has some efficient built-in features that maximize the cumulative efficiency. </span>

### **What Is a Ping and Why Does It Need To Be Low?**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2093" src="/assets/Ping-01-2.png" alt="WHAT IS A PING" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A ping is referred to a kind of signal that one computer sends to another through connected devices or computers of the same network. Therefore, ping means sending data packets or messages from one electronic device to another. The receiving end of the signal transmits and sends back a return ping to the device from where the originating ping was received. The amount of time in which the return ping is received by the computer which sent the ping in the first place is called Latency. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The lower the amount of latency is better for everyone around. Additionally, users can make with the latency of 100 milliseconds for online browsing and network surfing. However, for IT personnel and multiplayer online gamers, a latency of 50 milliseconds is required for a seamless online experience. Microsoft has been striving for many years to improve latency in Windows. Though, with the advent of newer technology like VR Oculus Rift and other demanding tech, lower latency has become a necessity. For online gamers, high latency, also known as “high ping spikes” or “Lag” really matters for an uninterrupted gaming experience. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Facing Lag in <a href="/blog/top-10-reasons-why-do-gamers-use-gaming-proxies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online gaming</a> can lead to an ineffective experience. In order to fix that problem is to resolve ping spikes. In this article, lowering ping times, reducing latency and improving networking experience are issues that are mainly targeted. Online gamers often face the issue of other players jumping around, appearing and then disappearing, which is due to the high ping. Ping is basically the measure of the connection speed or the latency of the <a href="/blog/how-to-speed-up-your-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet</a> connection. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people wrongly assume that a fast internet connection is about the download and upload speed. A responsive internet connection relies on a faster ping also known as “the reaction time”. A 98 milliseconds is the amount of time your computer takes to respond to a request forwarded by another computer. This means that the lowest ping is the ideal, which is better especially for online gamers. A ping of 300ms or more can present problems when playing an online game. Although, ping doesn’t directly affect the game itself, an unstable or huge ping becomes noticeable when reaction time is crucial. Racing games or first-person shooters are two examples, where instantaneous reaction time is crucial for winning. Fixing high ping can be make the process smooth. But before that, it has to be measured.</span>

### **How to Measure Your Ping**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2092" src="/assets/image2.png" alt="HOW TO MEASURE YOUR PING " width="720" height="386" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The latency of the internet connection can be checked by using </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Speedtest.net</span>](http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&xcust=06-3609346-11-0000000&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Etechadvisor%2Eco%2Euk%2Fhow%2Dto%2Fgame%2Fhow%2Dto%2Dlower%2Dping%2D3609346%2F&xs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Espeedtest%2Enet%2F)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is one of the most popular online speed tests. It was featured in one of the Iron Man movies. If the internet connection detects a ping lower than 20ms, it is better. However, anything higher than 150 ms can result in lags. If the ping is low, even the fastest PC with the best hardware will be unable to function, thus giving the user a distinct disadvantage in the online arena.</span>

### **Windows Updates for Windows 8 and 10**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Repairing the Windows updates is crucial to maintain the integrity of an efficient latency. Following are some definitive steps that can fix the ping spikes and unstable ping in Windows 8 and 10.</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The user must ascertain the drivers related to Windows 10 are of the newer model and up to date. If the user has an external LAN or <a href="/blog/wpa3-is-coming-this-year-to-enhance-wifi-router-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wifi</a>, latest drivers can be easily downloaded from the manufacturer’s website.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The user must update all relative drivers. This is a known way to fix the ping spikes and latency issues in Windows 10. If the issue is not resolved after upgradation of all relative drivers, user has to follow the steps given below to fix the ping spikes and high latency issue that can interfere with their online experience.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">To rectify the high latency issue, it should be ensured that Windows 10 are not downloaded from a central server. A peer-to-peer approach is much better in which a Windows update is downloaded by a person by receiving it from another person. </span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for high latency can be the updates, which the laptop/PC is sending to another person which can cause ping spikes. </span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">This issue can be resolved by turning off the feature. To do this, the user is required to go to the device’s </span><b>Settings-> Update & Security</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Under </span><b>Windows Update</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the user can navigate to </span><b>Advanced Options</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and click on it.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an option of </span><b>Choose How Updates Are Delivered</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Click on that.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">All that is additionally required is to turn off the </span><b>Updates from More Than One Place</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the method that can be handled in an efficient and effective method. All the users are required to do its navigation to the </span><b>Task Manager</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and sort out the applications based on their respective network usages in the section of </span><b>Processes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereafter, </span><b>Network Usages</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of different installed applications can be seen and monitored.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Those applications that are using a huge percentage of network can be turned off.</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The aforementioned steps can help fix high ping in Windows 10.</span>

### **Disable Wi-Fi Sense in Windows 10**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2087" src="/assets/Ping-03.png" alt="DISABLE WI-FI SENSE IN WINDOWS 10 " width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is to press </span>**Windows key + I**<span style="font-weight: 400;">, after which the </span>**settings** <span style="font-weight: 400;">can be accessed. The </span>**Network & Internet Option** <span style="font-weight: 400;">will provide the users with options from which Wifi needs to be selected from the left side bar.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span>**Manage Wi-Fi Settings** <span style="font-weight: 400;">will be displayed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The user can disable all the given options and the performance will improve.</span>

### **Turning off Location Tracker in Windows 8 and 10**

* <span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows 10 has a location feature that, if turned on, can be a reason for high ping or ping spikes. The user can get rid of an unstable ping by turning off location racking. </span>
* **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Access the location feature by locating </span>Settings -> Privacy.**

### 

### **Change Windows Connection Settings**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The user can choose to reset the Windows 10 Network Reset. This reset installs all the drivers and software that interact directly with the internet connection as well as the VPNs. If the user resets everything with time and patience, then a network connection reset can fix a number of internet connectivity settings. Change the settings by navigating to </span>**Settings > Network and Internet > Network reset**<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

### **Disable Automatic Updates of Windows**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows automatically downloads updates without asking for permission. Updates can run in the background while user is trying to game, which can result in a higher ping. As the Windows update cannot be paused, it is better to deal with the issue before they have started running. One of the direct ways to address the issue, is to navigate to the Windows 10 Settings. It lets user choose the amount of bandwidth the Windows updates can use. Most users have internet connections with moderate speeds and Windows updates that require 40% of the bandwidth that is unacceptable on all accounts. It is better to disable to restrict the updates.</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigate to the </span><b>Settings -> Update & Security</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose </span><b>Advanced Options</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Search for </span><b>Delivery Optimization</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose </span><b>Advanced Options</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> again.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower the upload and download bandwidth percentages. A limit of 10% is recommended as it will not interfere with user’s gaming experience or internet browsing and the update will be downloaded in a suitable amount of time.</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to deal with this situation is to inform Windows that internet connection is metered. This can trick the Windows into thinking that user has limited data on the Wi-Fi network and the Windows will not download updates while the user is connected to that metered connection. When the user wants to download the update, simply connect to another Wifi network or disable the metered setting and the Windows will download the updates as normal.</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to </span><b>Settings -> Network & Internet</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose </span><b>Ethernet</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the sidebar.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose the network connection that the device is currently connected to.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to </span><b>Set as Metered Connection </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">toggle.</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This can resolve the issue. However, changing these settings is a prerequisite, as many users miss out on critical driver and <a href="/blog/plugins-can-interfere-online-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security</a> updates.</span>

### **Monitoring the Wireless Signal**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2088" src="/assets/Ping-04.png" alt="MONITORING THE WIRELESS SIGNAL " width="720" height="360" />

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Checking the wireless signal is imperative for low latency. If the wireless signal is weak, one of the best ways to improve the situation is to move the PC or Laptop closer to the router.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">If that is not possible, a Wifi extender can be purchased or an Ethernet connection can be installed, which can amplify the internet signal.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">An improvement in wireless signals can be extremely helpful in repairing high ping issues.</span>
</li>

### **Third-Party Firewalls/ Antivirus Software**

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">If a user has a third-party firewall/ antivirus software installed on the PC or Laptop, there is an extremely probable chance that it is causing pink spikes.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">One effective way to deal with that problem is to disable the firewall or the antivirus and then checking again if the issue is resolved. If the issue remains the same, then the firewall is not to be blamed.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">If turning off the firewall doesn’t resolves the issue, it is best to uninstall the software or the firewall through its specialized removal tool provided by the manufacturer.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Recheck after uninstalling the antivirus and firewall and if the issue of unstable ping has resolved itself, it is better to change the firewall.</span>
</li>

### 

### **Running A Malware Or Virus Scan On the Laptop/PC**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2089" src="/assets/Ping-05.png" alt="RUNNING A MALWARE OR VIRUS SCAN ON THE LAPTOP/PC" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hidden viruses and malicious malware can target computer and cause unstable pings and missing data packets. They can also be the reason for underperforming wireless connections and latency issues. It is better to run a diagnostic test for any hidden virus or a malware scan to detect any unwanted program that is infecting the computer PC or Laptop. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After the diagnosing test, any harmful files can be deleted or fixed. The removal of such files can improve the system’s efficiency and can revive a desirable ping.</span>

### **Disable Microsoft Windows Kernel Debug Network Adapter in Windows 8**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixing bad ping or ping spikes in Windows 8 is much straight-forward. </span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigate to </span><b>Device Manager</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Find the option </span><b>Windows Kernel Debug Network Adapter</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sect the option of </span><b>Disable</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after right clicking on it.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">If </span><b>Windows Kernel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cannot be found easily, navigate from the top menu bar to </span><b>View</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There the </span><b>Windows Kernel Debug Network Adapter</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be spotted with ease.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Disable or uninstall the program and restart the Windows. Once the system reboots, the user won’t experience any ping spikes or bad pings afterwards.</span>
</li>

### 

### **Alternative Ways to Fix High Ping in Windows 10 and Windows 8**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2090" src="/assets/Ping-06.png" alt="ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO FIX HIGH PING IN WINDOWS 10 AND WINDOWS 8" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other ways that can be adopted to fix a bad ping situation, if the aforementioned ways do not work. There is no single definitive way to lower the ping. The user can employ a number of solutions and work through a trial and error process to find one that works best. An easy solution is to close all programs on the PC/Laptop and ensure that there are no running downloads active I the background, which can affect the latency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another issue can be an internet connection to which several devices are attached at the same time. If another device is running an application or software which is bandwidth hungry, this can certainly result in a higher ping. It will result in a higher ping when more devices will be connected by a single internet connection.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reducing a high ping can also be brought by connecting device directly to the router through power line adapters like </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">TP-Link AV2000 2-Port Gigabit Passthrough Power line</span>](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=13303&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FTL-PA9020PKIT-Passthrough-Powerline-Configuration-UK%2Fdp%2FB01FFBN4MO%3Fascsubtag%3D06-3609346-11-0000000)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. This can be instrumental in resolving high ping issues. Signal strength will be maximized that can directly affect the latency of the internet connection.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also advisable to check the connection and wires between the router and the wall box, ensuring that all the connections are plugged in securely. Many cable connection can become loose over time and many internet connectivity problems can easily be resolved by securing the wires tightly. If all else fails, router can be turned off and switched on again. Unplug the power cable from the router and wait a few minutes to plug it back again. The setup which consist of a router and a modem can benefit from this. In that case both the modem and the router will need to be turned off and on again.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the aforementioned step doesn’t work, the next logical step is to buy a new router. Most users have a default router provided by their internet service providers, but they can easily upgrade to a better router like </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">ASUS-AC88U</span>](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=13303&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FASUS-RT-AC88U-AiProtection-Accelerator-aggregation%2Fdp%2FB019MKO43M%3Fascsubtag%3D06-3609346-11-0000000) <span style="font-weight: 400;">that can greatly improve the internet speed and also improve the Wi-Fi coverage. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">User should contact their internet service provider in case the above mentioned steps are followed and the ping is still high. A professional will be able to locate the acute reason for the high ping and will be able to fix potential problems remotely. </span>
