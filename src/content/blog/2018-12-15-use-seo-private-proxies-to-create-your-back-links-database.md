<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you a website owner? Do you know the importance of SEO and backlinks? Also, do you know how you can create backlinks using private proxies? Let us discuss them one by one in this article.</span>

<figure id="attachment_3016" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3016" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-3016 size-full" src="/assets/SEO-01.png" alt="SEO" width="720" height="360" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3016" class="wp-caption-text">What is SEO?</figcaption></figure>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is the dynamic procedure of increasing the quantity and quality of visitors to any website by gaining good page rankings in the algorithmic search engine results. It is not as easy as it sounds. Only if you use decent SEO techniques, you will be able to move to the top of the search results. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO is reasonably the most crucial factor that determines the success rate of almost every website on the WWW (World Wide Web).  Making your SEO right should be the first priority on your list of strategies that you have planned for the development of your website.</span>

<figure id="attachment_3018" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3018" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-3018 size-full" src="/assets/SEO-02.png" alt="BackLinks" width="720" height="360" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3018" class="wp-caption-text">What are Backlinks?</figcaption></figure>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are more than 200 parameters based on which Google provides a rank to any website. And without any doubt the main parameter considered by Google is Backlinks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Backlinks are actually the hyperlinks which are linked to your website from other websites. Your website&#8217;s Google ranking is directly proportional to the number of backlinks. Which means the more backlinks your website has, the higher Google ranking you will get. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that you should always keep in mind is not every Backlink has the same value from Google&#8217;s perception. Google checks how authentic is the website linking back to you. Google also checks domain authority which is measured on the scale of 0 to 100. Getting backlinks from the websites which have a higher domain authority than that of your website is what you need to focus on. You can use the tool ahrefs.com to check the domain authority of your website as well as other websites. A backlink from a website which has a higher domain authority than that of your website will hold very less value if the website is not related to your website in terms of content or the products or services you offer.</span>

### **What is a proxy and how it works?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every system in a computer network has a unique IP address. No two end devices can have the same IP address in the same computer network. The Internet is smart enough and it knows how to send the correct data packet to the correct computer on the basis of the IP address.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A proxy server is basically a computer(server) on the internet with its own IP address (which could be multiple in number) that your computer knows. When you initiate a web request, your request goes to the proxy server first. The proxy server then forwards your web request on your behalf to the web server, and then revert back the response from the web server to your computer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While forwarding the request the proxy server can make changes (if it is configured in such a way) to the data packets you send. For example, a  proxy server can mask your IP address, so the web server doesn’t know exactly where you are in the world. It can also encrypt your data, to prevent your data from getting intercepted by any hacker. It can also act as a firewall by blocking and allowing certain inbound and outbound traffic as per the requirement. Basically, when you use a proxy, you are rerouting your traffic from your original ISP server to the proxy server. This has a number of benefits in terms of SEO which we are going to discuss in this article. </span>

### **Advantages of using Backlinks:**

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The backlinks on popular websites will not only help you in SEO but it will also help you in bringing prospects to your brand.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">A search on Google, Yahoo, and other search engines produce a lot of traffic. But not all traffic is produced from searches. The traffic produced by users click on the backlinks is very much comparable to the other sources of traffic. Even a single link on a well-known website will help you in gaining a steady traffic to your website for years. One very useful fact about this type of traffic is that it is highly convertible. </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">They are high chances that if someone gets to read a good content and if he/she discovers a backlink pointing to your website, they will click on the backlink to know more about your website and the products and services you offer. You can see the power of a mere backlink which can bring you more customers  without any extra effort. They might join and support your social media campaigns or they might read your blog and then share the same with their relevant folks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, there are two types of proxies: public proxies and private proxies. Public proxies are easily available for free and are used by multiple users at once. Private proxies are dedicated proxies which are paid. You must be wondering why anyone will use paid proxies when free proxies are available? You should know that free proxies don&#8217;t come alone, they bring a bunch of issues along with them. They are slow, overused, heavily shared, and they don’t work all of the time. In worst cases, they are just set up with an intention to steal your confidential data from you. With dedicated paid SEO proxies, you get an assurance that they are not abused before and your data are in same hands.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Use of SEO private proxies to develop backlinks is not the safest option, apparently more risky for your websites. As there are great chances that Google would take action against your website by putting down your ranking.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As backlinks are very beneficial for your website, you will try creating as many links as possible. But, before you initiate the backlink creation mission, there is something you should never forget. When you use the combination of proxies and tools, it is very obvious to think of creating many numbers of backlinks. This is not at all a good thought, as Google and other search engines check if the links are organic or not. A crazy number of links will indicate that the links are not organic. It is possible to use the tools without the proxies, but that would be a great mistake. As you are going to collect a lot of data and build a lot of Backlinks. If you won&#8217;t use proxies there are great chances that your public IP address may get banned.</span>
