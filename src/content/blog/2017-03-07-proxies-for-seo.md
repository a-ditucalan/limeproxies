SEO is perhaps the most important factor determining the success rate of almost every website on the World Wide Web. It therefore goes without saying that getting your SEO right should be the first item on your list of things that are to be done to make your website visible.

Given the high significance, most of you may already be familiar with the various SEO software available in the market. Such software platforms provide you with a lot of convenience in your SEO efforts.

Nevertheless, in order to make the most out of these platforms, you will need to add to your budget as you will probably need proxies to aid you in your attempt to boost your website’s ranking.

As such, here you will find some useful tips with regards to what factors you need to take into account in order to get the perfect proxy provider for your SEO software.

**What is a proxy?**

Before we can jump into the details, it is worth mentioning as to what a proxy actually is. Simply said, _a proxy acts as a middleman between your computer and the website that you want to access._

Essentially, when you use a proxy, you are rerouting your traffic from your original ISP server to the proxy server. This has a number of benefits in terms of SEO.

**Benefits of using proxies**

Some of you may not be familiar with **why many SEO specialists make use of proxies for SEO**. So let us have a look at what these reasons are.

First and foremost, proxies can ease your actual server be redirecting a great deal of traffic to the proxy server. This is because keyword search can take a lot of bandwidth and as such, searching on a single server may significantly slow down your process and therefore cost time.

Secondly, SEO usually involves sending a number of search queries to various search engines such as Google. It is often the case that when a great deal of such queries are being sent from a single IP address, search engines consider it as spam and block the respective IP address.

Hence, it is only sensible to use different proxies to run your queries effectively without being blocked whatsoever.

**How to find the right proxy for your SEO software**

Simply finding proxies is not as hard as finding legitimate and reliable proxies. There are a number of free proxies that can be used for SEO purposes.

However, since many others might be using the same one for purposes that might be far from [**free proxies run the risk of getting blocked**][1] safe. As such, it is likely that these proxies get blocked altogether.

So here are some guidelines you can use to find the perfect proxy.

### #1 – Using the direct approach

A simple search on the web will give you hundreds of links to all sorts of proxy providers. Simply going through their website is definitely not going to do the trick.

Instead, it would be a good idea to choose a provider that you think is appropriate and call them directly to ask them regarding their services. It therefore goes without saying that if the provider is genuine, it will have an authentic contact link that you can use to connect with it.

Information that you might want to ask may include the different types of proxies on offer, whether they are compatible with the SEO software you are using, what other software platforms may be used with the proxies provided etc.

If the provider really is legit, they will provide you with all the necessary information with regards to the SEO software platforms that you will be using with their proxies.

### #2 – Determining the reliability of the infrastructure

As mentioned earlier, there are numerous proxy server providers claiming to have the best quality proxies in the market. Nevertheless, we know better and as such, it is vital that you look into how reliable is the network of the provider you are purchasing the proxy from.

You will need to ensure that the provider has a **robust infrastructure with ample support staff** that can be accessed conveniently.

### #3 – Look out for those who are offering too much for too little

There are various instances where a number of proxy server providers claim that they will keep changing their servers should an existing server is blocked.

Although this may sound quite impressive, it is a red flag as it is not that easy to keep changing proxy servers. [Proxy servers][2] cost a lot of money to operate and a single provider cannot afford to change them so rapidly.

### #4 – Multiple location proxy servers

In addition to the benefits mentioned earlier, using proxies also allow you to optimize search results for overseas. As you may know, search engines such as Google use smart algorithms that produce results specific to your country.

This may prove to be quite problematic as the same query may show different results in a different country. Therefore, **using proxies in multiple locations allow you to test your website’s search ability in locations other than your home country.**

It is thus recommended to use providers who have servers in different locations so as to allow you to optimize your website more effectively.

### #5 – Security

Essentially, there are three different types of proxies – **SOCKS, HTTPS** and **HTTP**. HTTP is the usual one that majority of the providers sell. SOCKS and HTTPS are relatively less common.

SOCKS and HTTPS, however, are more secure than HTTP. As such, they may be quite expensive to get.

Nevertheless, since SOCKS and HTTPS are not that common, they are much less prone to get blocked by various search engines.

You can [buy socks proxies][3] from Limeproxies price starts from $50 for 10 multi location proxies.

### #6 – Type of IP

One of the most common concerns when buying a proxy is whether to [buy a proxy][4] with a residential IP address or a datacenter IP address.

**Residential IP addresses** are simply the ones that are assigned to you by your original ISP. It can be easily looked up by simply searching “What is my IP address” on the web.

**Datacenter IP address,** on the other hand, is an **IP assigned by data centers** and is what most proxy providers offer. Therefore, if someone wants to track you down, all they will see is the datacenter IP address with the details of the company who owns the center.

At the outset, datacenter IP address seems to be more appropriate as they are cheaper and more common than residential IPs. However, with ever-evolving technology, search engines such as Google now have the ability to differentiate between a datacenter IP and a residential one.

Primarily, search queries sent from datacenter IPs are considered as queries sent from bots and can therefore be blocked. Residential IP address queries, in contrast, are considered as queries from humans and are therefore less likely to get banned.

It is therefore a good idea to seek a provider that gives proxies with residential IP addresses.

**Conclusion**

The aforementioned guidelines are not exhaustive. However, they are enough to give you a head start in [choosing the right proxy for your SEO software.][5]
