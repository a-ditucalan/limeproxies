<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you all know the security is the most important concern for all of us in this <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="https://www.limevpn.com/5-ways-to-improve-your-online-privacy-and-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital </a>world. But do you really know that there are different forms of <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="https://www.limevpn.com/5-ways-to-improve-your-online-privacy-and-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security </a>features?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, let&#8217;s discuss the most important feature you use, it is the WPA.</span>

**<a style="color: #f04b23;" href="https://www.limevpn.com/why-should-you-be-safe-on-public-wifi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wifi </a>Protected Access** <span style="font-weight: 400;">in short </span>**WPA** <span style="font-weight: 400;">is one of the most important aspects of Wifi devices/routers. If you are using a Wifi device you will notice the option as WPA2 access in the Wifi interface under <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="https://www.limevpn.com/tips-on-how-to-create-a-secure-password/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">password </a>security or <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="/blog/need-know-encryption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">encryption</a>. This is the latest update everyone is using as it is a standard/universal feature.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All the wireless routers available currently are WPA2 enabled and this standard is set by the Wifi alliance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But did you know that recently there were a lot of concerns raised on the security of WPA2? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet experts found that there were a lot of security issues with the WPA2 <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="/blog/impact-of-edward-snowden-on-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protocol</a>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is the list of some basic vulnerabilities:</span>

* ### **Anyone can disconnect you from the network you are connected to :**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, You read it right, anyone on your network can disconnect or kick you out of the same network without any special types of equipment or special <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="/blog/access-blocked-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">access</a>, A tiny program along with something called as DEAUTH packets has to be sent and you will be automatically disconnected from the network without being able to get back to the network again.</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <h3>
    <b><a style="color: #f04b23;" href="https://www.limevpn.com/how-to-bypass-geo-blocking-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bypass </a>the password for your network</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> : </span>
  </h3>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone can crack the password for the network, once a Wifi handshake is done, the password can easily be sniffed without even being connected to the same network again, the rate of successful attempts definitely depends on the type of password or the complexity of the password. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ranging from 1-2 hours for a normal password to 6-8 hours for a complex one.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is always recommended to set an irrelevant password for your network so that it takes ages to be <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="https://www.dnfinder.com/blog/5-tips-keep-hackers-away-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hacked</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, minimum password requirements should be increased from 8 characters to 12 or maybe 15 characters which should be a combination of alphanumeric and special characters making it very difficult for an individual to bypass it.</span>

## **WPA3 &#8211; Wifi Protected Access(Version 3.0)**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1321" src="/assets/38729413345_b455e1581b_o.png" alt="WIFI Router Security" width="700" height="368" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">WPA3, the next generation authentication for Wifi devices is soon to be launched, even though the release dates are not yet announced, experts have found out the contents of this update. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we all know how software updates are launched, with few <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="/blog/impact-of-edward-snowden-on-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security </a>patches and a whole new change in UI, WPA3 is expected to be launched with something new and not just an update.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wifi alliance has announced that WPA3 will be out with new and user-friendly security implementations including a 192-bit <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="/blog/what-you-need-to-know-now-about-encryption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">encryption</a>, although it will be using the 48-bit initialization vector just like WPA2.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The WPA3 protocol is also designed to fit in the most secure networks like those of </span>**Government, Defense** <span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span> **Industrial** <span style="font-weight: 400;">Systems.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another and the most important feature introduced in WPA3 is the </span>**DragonFly Protocol** <span style="font-weight: 400;">which provides an encrypted connection during Wifi handshakes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This implementation is surely going to make WPA3 a simple and easy to use protocol compared to its predecessor.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have discussed a lot of technical terms which everyone would not easily understand, but WPA3 is designed for everyone and not only for a Techie who knows in and out of networks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wifi alliance has promised that this protocol will be hard to crack for networks having the weakest passwords of all, so anyone who is having a hard time to remember a combination of letters and numbers, this is a boon as you no longer have to set huge-irrelevant passwords. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, people who work or browse remotely or use public networks in coffee shop/airport/hotel need not worry as WPA3 includes Individual data encryption which means that your device and the router network you are connected to will be encrypted with a unique key avoiding brute <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="/blog/fbi-8-steps-prevent-phishing-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attacks</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The list of updates made on WPA3 clearly indicates that the aim is to enhance security for basic users. Similarly it is also expected to have a simple Wifi connections for device that do not have a good interface for Wifi <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="https://www.limevpn.com/improve-the-speed-of-your-vpn-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">connections</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">WPA3 has been used in some places. However, the device manufacturers are still waiting for an approval from Wifi alliance to label the compatible devices with WPA3 seal. Although it is highly impossible to replace all the WPA2 certified devices due to a high increase in devices being manufactured in the <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="https://www.limevpn.com/is-there-privacy-in-digital-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital </a>market.</span>

## **Conclusion :**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">WPA3 is not a full-time replacement for its predecessor WPA2 as it is not possible for all the users to replace the incompatible routers at once. On the other end, Wifi alliance has also announced security checks on WPA2 to decrease the impact of security vulnerabilities on wireless networks. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also always go for proxies when you are on a <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="/blog/how-to-hide-my-public-ip-address/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public or a open network</a> as it will be an added security.</span>
