<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a good <a href="/blog/digital-marketers-using-windows-10-increase-efficiency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketer</a> can open many business doors and help it grow. It’s essential to know how to attract people and make them permanent customers. Should we say marketing is a skill or a talent? Either ways a good marketer must be intelligent enough to know how to go about their occupation.  Below are certain tips that can help a marketing team.</span>

### **Know the product**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This goes a long way in ensuring a marketer can speak about everything pertaining by the rating it in the form of the <a href="https://classylaxcarservice.com/" style="border: none; color: #333333; font-weight: normal !important; text-decoration: none;" >stay classy airport lax service</a> to the product they are selling. The product you are trying to sell is very important because it gives you clues on the market to target, for example trying to sell baby diapers to young college students who don’t need it, the best market for this would be married, pregnant women.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a good understanding of the product and the targeted market, you know the benefits the product will bring to that market specifically. This gives you the opportunity to tailor your sales pitches, adverts and propositions towards them in a way they begin to see the benefits this product will bring to their life.</span>

### **Have a good working ethics**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethically influencing <a href="/blog/a-guide-on-customer-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customers</a> for the benefit of all those involved is different from doing it by malicious manipulation, and knowing the difference goes a long way in keeping the company’s reputation and that a marketer doesn’t end up with regrets. A good working ethic keeps you from hating the work you are doing and also keeps you motivated at all times </span>

### **Have a good knowledge and sense of what is beneficial for a human being.**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing how beneficial a product helps to sell the product, because the more the person knows what benefits they stand to gain the more interested they become in the product. So, in essence you have to have a pretty good knowledge on the viability of the product you are selling.</span>

### **Know the difference between male and female.**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing is a trade where knowing the difference in male and female, affects your ability to perform in it. Men and women have different needs and want and having a good knowledge about them enable you to know the better products for each of them and better marketing approach for each of them.</span>

### **Know how to predict future trends**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a very important skill for a marketer because it allows you to plan your <a href="/blog/ultimate-startup-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketing strategies</a> for a future trend and also ensures your marketing becomes sustainable in the long run. This also allows a marketer avoid excessive costs in the future.</span>

### **Keep contacts of all the professionals in your workplace**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing is a professional work and having a professional network often create opportunities for everyone involved. This will give you access to other peoples professional advice and even consultations.</span>

### **Aim for win-win situations**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a good and positive mindset towards the bare minimum of the economic situations created to be beneficial to everyone affected by it.  One person doesn’t have to win while another loses, basically this means that the business gets its client and the clients get the value of the service. Knowing how to create these kinds of situations constantly is very financially beneficial.</span>

### **Know how to create good relationships between people**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing how to create a harmonious relationships with people is going to be of benefit right from day one, working in professional teams and clients is a lot easier when you know how to create a harmonious relationship with others, becomes it makes you tolerable and also charming, it makes you the kind of person people want to be around and work with. If you don’t have a good relationship with clients or you don’t relate well with them, it can turn them off even if your ideas are good.</span>

### **Know that there are different types of customers and the mass psychology of that group.**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you segment customers in to groups it allows you study them and discern clues about them that will be will benefit them. Also pay attention to how the group and how they function as a whole for instance hip hop music fans would have a different mass psychology from rock music fans and being able to tell the differences between them allows for better interactions with them.   </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being ahead of the pack as a marketer is not an easy task. There are lots of new strategies, new tools, and new channels to experiment with. Retention marketing, Customer marketing, and growth marketing in the <a href="/blog/10-saastr-annual-speakers-to-follow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaS</a> space is all very interesting facets for marketers because they basically shift the focus to the customers from the buyer. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the new Age of the Customer, good business and marketing are majorly about being customer-centric. That means more companies are coming up with better approaches and programs that are significant to their customers. But how do we ensure marketing teams have the information they need to make basic decisions about post-sale activities? To achieve this, a marketer needs marketing strategies which communicate an overall value to their customers. Certainly, a good marketing plays a huge role in every stage of the buyer to customer journey, but in order to achieve these, marketers need a few basic tools or strategies ranging from user intelligence, targeted engagements, and customer health…</span>

### **User intelligence**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same way they need to collect lead data to ensure pre-sale efforts are relevant, marketers also need customer data to ensure their post-sale communications are effective. For marketers, this means understanding how customers are (or aren’t) engaging inside the product.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With this intelligence, marketers focused on post-sale activities can organize campaigns that are ignited by events that take place within their product. They can also set up campaigns to be triggered by customer success teams or customer success data. In turn, this gives pre-sale marketers reviews and testimonials they can use in collateral and other efforts. It’s a win-win for everyone.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">User intelligence also enlightens marketers on buyers personal transition when they become customers, as well as gain insight into who your best customers are and help define an ICP that can be replicated to target new customers in marketing/sales process. This complete end-to-end view of a customer gives marketers an incredible amount of insight into behaviour and user attributes that can inform pre-sale marketing tactics. The more marketers know about the buyers who transited to become customers, the better they can organise efficient programs they can attract, retain, and expand those buyers.</span>

### **Targeted engagements**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For product marketers specifically, often the best way to reach customers with relevant communications is while they’re in the product itself. Pre-sale marketers spend time sending nurture emails, developing<a href="/blog/10-instagram-marketing-tips-for-brands-and-social-media-managers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> social media</a> posts, and attending trade shows because their pool is scattered across a variety of channels. But for post-sale marketers, the target audience (customers) is more contained in only a couple of usable channels: in-product and via email.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In-product engagements can do great deal of things for customer-centric marketers, like offer the opportunity to collect customer feedback or send important marketing materials.</span>

### **Customer health**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer health is usually not a metric that marketers are thinking about, but in the post-sale stages, it’s actually very critical. That’s because healthy customers should be receiving different marketing approaches than unhealthy customers. This works in a pretty similarly manner to lead scoring and can even be used to trigger campaigns and rules to execute when customers hit certain health marks, it’s like issuing a “red alert” to notify the assigned CSM when a health score is getting low or delivering an NPS survey especially when the score is high.</span>

## **Marketing strategies**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1909" src="/assets/Marketing-strategies.png" alt="KEY MARKETING PRINCIPLES Customer Intelligence Tools " width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They go a long way in the transition of buyers to customers. A good marketing strategy helps increase sales by a larger percent. Below are few marketing strategies to help with marketing.</span>

### **Relationship marketing**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a good relationship with your customers is very essential in marketing because a customer who loves your brand would prefer spending more money on your products rather than somewhere else. Many retailers have found this to be true.</span>

### **Transaction marketing**

 <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Increasing sales can be very challenging, especially for retailers who have to consistently sell products in high volume to their consumers. In order to keep up with the demands of investors, retailers have to encourage consumers to buy using discounts, liquidations, coupons, and sales events. High volume big box retailers are constantly running promotional events to get interested consumers into their store.</span>

### **Scarcity marketing**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In some market it’s important to control the number of products being made available in it. This is due to the rareness of acquiring the material, and since the prestige on such goods would be high, definitely people would buy it because they can’t get it anywhere else. Rolls-Royce released a Chinese edition car called phantom and sold quickly, even though the price was higher than most cars, scarcity had an effect on the desire and price.</span>

### **Call to action (CTA) marketing**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This refers to the conversion of online traffic into leads or sales on websites using graphics, texts or other elements of web design. These increases the numbers of online visitors who become customers or join the mailing list.   </span>

### **Viral marketing**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This basically entails coming up with new business ideas that keep their products in the heart of their consumers. Giving their customers a reason to dream about their future purchase. An important factor in growing awareness for business is getting your customers talking about your product and services.</span>

### **Diversity marketing**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Come up with a marketing plan based on the cultural differences of the customers including beliefs tastes, world views, and specific needs.</span>

### **Undercover marketing**

### **Mass marketing**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Large businesses need to drive a large amount of their major purchase in order to survive and grow. Big business spend money to get data on the market to target. This gives them the insight to place media for potential customers who buy their products and services.</span>

### **Seasonal marketing**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Seasonal event gives the opportunity to meet new customers, sometimes this events can be a national holiday or a change in weather. This allows a business to turn to various seasons that are important to their customers so to become more relevant in their lives.</span>

### **Online marketing**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The development in information technology has made this possible, and advert can reach millions of people at a time. A new form of marketing has emerged has commerce propagated itself to the internet. From online adds, banners and the annoying pop ups marketers attempt everything they can to get their customers attention</span>

### **Evangelism marketing**

### **Direct marketing**

### **Content marketing**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing and publishing content to enlighten your potential customers about your products and services. This can very even more effective than using direct selling methods.</span>

### **Social media marketing**

Social Media marketing is still growing but rather quickly.</span>

## **KEY MARKETING PRINCIPLES**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1910" src="/assets/KEY-MARKETING-PRINCIPLES.png" alt="types of customers" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Majorly there are four principles of marketing which are</span>

* <span style="font-weight: 400;">Specialization</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">Differentiation</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">Segmentation</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">Concentration</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To start with </span>**specialisation**<span style="font-weight: 400;">; this is a product service area of marketing you focus all your efforts. In specialization it can be a product or service it can be a particular customer that you want to serve or it can be a particular market area that you want to work in for example MCDonald&#8217;s, MCDonald&#8217;s customers are people who want to eat quickly and they want cleanliness, efficiency, value, price and pleasance around it, and so what they do is they offer every single product they can for people who want to eat quickly.</span>

**Differentiation** <span style="font-weight: 400;">is your competitive advantage, it’s your area of superiority. It’s something you do better than everybody else and your unique selling propositions. Where are you or could you be “the best”? Is the thing you offer no other person in the world offers . Let’s say you are a real estate agent what’s your unique selling propositions that any other real estate agent doesn’t have? Since you all sell the same thing, the answer is </span>**yourself** <span style="font-weight: 400;">(your personality, preparations, friendliness, phone calls…) you have a superior effort to build a really high quality relationship with the homebuyer or seller so that person would never think of anywhere else. Where are you or could you be </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">best at? This is a really good question because everybody, company ,firms have the ability to be the best at something that people would eagerly pay for and tell their friends about and your job is to figure out what that is, do it continuously and make improvements.</span>_

**Segmentation;** _<span style="font-weight: 400;">is who are those customers, that most appreciate your area of superiority, who are your very best customers. You’re a customers are those that like you, they’re happy to buy from you, they come again, they bring their friends, they give you recommendations and testimonials where as your worst customers are those you have to literally break your back to sell to them, they complain about anything and they don’t pay.</span>_

### **Basics things to know about your targeted customer                **

_**What are their demographics**<span style="font-weight: 400;">; the customers your product is targeting what are their age, income, education, family formation? This are things you need to know about them to further tailor the goods and services towards their satisfaction, because a satisfied customer would always want to come ba</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">ck for more and propagate the business.</span>

_**What are their psychographics**<span style="font-weight: 400;">;</span>_ <span style="font-weight: 400;">psychographics are what motivates them and this is where the future is for your business and everybody has psychographics. This is about knowing what your customers love about your product and this can enable you work on that. Under psychographics you need to know</span>

 <span style="font-weight: 400;">1) what are your customer’s needs, want and motivation?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">2) Fear, doubts and worries? You should know about what holds them back from getting your product and work on it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">3) Problems to be solved? What is the problem you solve for your customers if they use your product and services?</span>

_**Knowing how to describe your perfect customers;**_ <span style="font-weight: 400;">your perfect customers are lovers of your product like die-hard fans of your product. Knowing who they are in mass allows you to know what market to target for better sales efficiency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">IBM for example had so much and so little was going to the government that the government tried bringing them down for about 13 years and they tried filing lawsuits against them but couldn’t find anything to use against them because their customers loved their products and spoke well of it. IBM realized that when they started selling the 360 mainframe in the 19,’s people were impressed because they were making a major expression that they can now put everything on the computer, (basically everything was in paper that time) and they had to make their presentations to the senior executives of the company, then work out all the numbers.</span>

 <span style="font-weight: 400;">As computers began to get more and more developed they started to have personal computers, desktops and so on, the whole decision shifted to the purchasing manager of the large companies and they had to focus and change all of their marketing to focus it on the purchasing manager and learn more on how purchasing managers think and communicate, the size of their firm, their income, psychographics and demographics they focus all their efforts on purchasing managers and became the biggest selling company in the world. They were in control of 80% of the world market because they realised what their customers wanted and worked on it.</span>

_**Concentration;**_ <span style="font-weight: 400;">is where you focus your time, money and resources. In concentration there are terms and things to take note of</span>

**1)      What are the best possible ways to contact your ideal customers?**

**2)      What are the best possible media?**

**3)      What are the most powerful appeals?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can just increase the efficiency of the advertisement and focusing your message with greater clarity on your best customers you can get 5 to 10 times the response per advertisement that you’re seeing before. What are the best possible media to use? Most people use the internet but the internet is just one method of communication and it’s still small relative to all the other forms of advertising.</span>

## **TYPES OF CUSTOMERS**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1911" src="/assets/TYPES-OF-CUSTOMERS.png" alt="marketing strategies" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We can classify the types of customers into four. There are different types of clients, knowing the customers you are targeting is a very important key factor in marketing. Majorly because it would give marketers access to valuable information on what approach to use for this types of customers.</span>

_**CHEAP CLIENTS;**_ <span style="font-weight: 400;">this types of customers are majorly driven by price, its either your price is good for the product or services they are purchasing or they aren’t interested in buying.</span>

_**DIFFICULT CLIENTS**_<span style="font-weight: 400;">; Difficult customers are not necessarily cheap they are just difficult, they aren’t that pleasant, they don’t smile that much and you have to learn how to deal with them on a professional bases. You have to know how to relate with them and you must have a very good knowledge on the product you are marketing, in order to convince them to like the product. You have to calve the marketing message to aim at this kind of customers.</span>

** _SOPHISTICATED CUSTOMERS;_** <span style="font-weight: 400;">this set of customers have money, they are educated and they know what they are buying. So by giving them more information about your product you make them feel you know what you’re talking about. They ask a lot of intelligent questions.</span>

** _AFFLUENT CUSTOMERS_**<span style="font-weight: 400;">; They buy based on feelings for example they want a car and their buying criteria may be “I feel it’s a cool car”. This set of customers don’t need to be enlighten much as the difficult customers.</span>

### **CONCLUSION**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically the best ways to keep pace with customers’ intelligence as a marketing team, is to have  good quality of marketers, have a good strategy, and know the types of customers you want to sell to. All this would help the marketing team to do their work effectively and efficiently.</span>
