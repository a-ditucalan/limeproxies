<span style="font-weight: 400;">We all use the internet even for the smallest things. Have you ever wondered how searching the internet works? How results of things you search for on the internet takes less than a few seconds to reach you? Well, one reason to this is a </span>**Proxy Server.** <span style="font-weight: 400;">Proxy servers basically act as middlemen between the client system and the internet while you search for data. Technically, when you search for something, the query goes through the proxy server to the internet and the result comes back to your system through the proxy server.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, when a user requests data on the internet on a particular web browser, the request passes through an intermediary to reach the particular website that contains the information. This intermediary is called a proxy server. Once the request passes through the proxy server, the server saves the request in its cache. This way, the next time you search for the same information, the data is retrieved directly from the proxy server. This gives us an advantage of not going to the internet again for the particular data or resource.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU0PVSJCKcs">CBTNUGGETS</a> that explains more about Proxy Servers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just in case a particular response has not been cached previously or it is a first time search, the proxy server sends the request to remote servers connecting it to all relevant servers. These servers search for the data on behalf of the client computer. Once the data is spotted, it is sent to the proxy server by the remote servers and here it then caches this information.</span>

### [**But why use it?**](http://www.limeproxies.com/why-limeproxies.php)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a proxy server gives us a lot of advantages. The various purposes for using a proxy server are listed below:</span>

### **Security**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Proxy servers help in containing the anonymity of the client. When you search for something on the internet, you open your identity to the open internet world that is filled with the unimaginable dangers. When you use a proxy server, it hides your IP address which is basically the sole identity to your system. The request for any search goes as a request from the proxy server and not the client. This preserves the security of the user.</span>

### **Faster Results**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you use a proxy server remember how it works. Only if it is a first time search or any failure in previous caching, the request goes to the internet to get results. Otherwise, the proxy server caches everything you search for. As all the results of your previous requests are cached, your next search will be very fast as the result is already in the proxy server.</span>

### **GeoLocating users**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, to render this feature, the website has to know your IP address. And this is termed illegal in many countries. For this purpose, you can use a proxy server. Proxy servers located in various parts of the world locate their nearest IP address even without the website tracing the IP address. This has helped in the accurate and successful implementation of the Geolocating feature.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, a user can use a blocked site from a particular country by using a local proxy that is located in that country to access the website.</span>

### **Block sites**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the public <a href="/blog/wpa3-is-coming-this-year-to-enhance-wifi-router-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wi-Fi</a>, mainly in schools, colleges, offices and other similar institutions always have a few blacklisted or blocked websites. You cannot access them until the main server gives you the access which will never happen. Most of these sites are social media sites blocked for the most obvious reasons. This can be easily done by a proxy server. It can restrict a particular site from coming through to the client server from the internet once it is blacklisted.</span>

### **Bypass filters**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the opposite of the above feature. You can access a blocked site easily if you are using a proxy server. Â You can switch from your institution or office <a href="/blog/what-is-proxy-server-and-how-it-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proxy server</a> to an open proxy server (which is definitely not very secure) as the filters are placed only on the particular proxy server. You can do this by simply using a free proxy server software.</span>

### **Load Balancing**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of us are not aware that load balancers are very necessary to drive traffic on the internet. While every hosting <a href="/blog/choosing-the-best-domain-name-for-optimum-brand-awareness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">domain</a> has its own load balancers, when it comes to a single client system, proxy servers act as a load balancer. They drive workload among various HTTP servers for faster performance.</span>

### **Types of proxy servers**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few kinds of basic proxies as below.</span>

### **Anonymous proxy**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you search for a particular information using this proxy, there is no way that your IP address will be revealed. Not only it masks your IP address but also when a request goes out from your system to the internet, only the IP address of the proxy server is revealed. Your IP is secure.</span>

### **Elite or High Anonymity Proxy**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The highest security that a proxy can provide is here. This proxy has the highest level of anonymity wherein the anonymous proxy, the user system IP is not revealed but the IP of the proxy is shown making the receiver aware that a proxy has been used. However, in this proxy neither the client system nor the proxy <a href="/blog/rotate-ip-address/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP</a> is shown. The receiver will not be aware of the request was made by a system or a proxy server.</span>

### **Transparent Proxy**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The name says it all. This proxy server is transparent enough to give away all your information when you send out a request. Mostly this works in an intranet environment where all your activity is known to the management. However, for a person sharing personal information only, this is no way a safe way to browse.</span>

### **Reverse Proxy**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This proxy is usually used by very secure, closed or private networks. This proxy passes requests from the <a href="/blog/how-to-speed-up-your-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet</a> through a firewall to an isolated network. This is done for the security of the clients do not have a direct access to sensitive data on an isolated network.</span>
