<span style="font-weight: 400;">We know why you bought a proxy or a batch of proxies, but don’t take it in the creepy way. The primary use of proxies is <a href="https://goo.gl/YZrULA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anonymity </a>anyway so we have a pretty good idea as to why you are keen to use your proxy. No one will know who you are and where you are anymore because you are hiding behind a proxy <a href="/blog/rotate-ip-address/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP address</a>. From now on your identity and <a href="/blog/how-to-maintain-phone-privacy-get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy</a> are secured and protected by a wall that is proxy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But did you know that you can actually make money with proxies? Of course you can. If you use it wisely and properly you can benefit from it financially. Sure, you would need a certain level of technical know-how in order to achieve this, but with perseverance, hard work, and persistence, you can reap the monetary benefits of using proxies.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This article will give you 6 tips to make money with proxies in a totally acceptable, ethical, and legal way. I bet you are excited, but before we start we just have to say that proxies do not really have a good reputation. When proxies first emerged, it was viewed in a negative light as some thought that it was used only by people hiding their suspicious and even criminal acts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, proxies are used by some people to gain <a href="/blog/make-money-online-selling-event-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">money</a> in an unethical way. These methods will not be discussed here because they are highly discouraged. Instead, we give you legitimate and ethical options that can help you make money.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount of money you earn using your proxies, however, will largely depend on your expertise and dedication. It may take some time before you will see the fruit of your labor, but the secret is not to quit. So here are those 6 tips we promised you. </span>

### **1. Setup Public Proxy Server with Ads**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1955" src="/assets/Make-Money-02.png" alt="make money with proxies by SETTING UP PUBLIC PROXY SERVER WITH ADS" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Proxies are most commonly used as an internet browser. Users look for a public proxy and browse the internet with the intention to hide their real <a href="/blog/how-to-hide-my-public-ip-address/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP addresses</a> and identity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since you own a proxy or a batch of proxies, you can very well set up your very own public proxy that can be used by anyone and then enable <a href="https://goo.gl/kyqawc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advertisements</a> so that you will earn money from clicks and other activities on the ad.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You would need a software such as Glype in order to set this up. Glype is a web-based proxy script that is written in PHP language. You can opt for its free plan which is suitable for personal use, but they also have a paid plan.</span>

### **2. Use SERP (Search Engine Results Page) Tracker for Google Rankings**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1956" src="/assets/Make-Money-03.png" alt="USE SERP (SEARCH ENGINE RESULTS PAGE) TRACKER FOR GOOGLE RANKINGS" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the emergence of <a href="/blog/how-to-use-b2b-seo-to-generate-high-quality-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search Engine Optimization</a> (SEO) as a huge business opportunity, websites are striving to be on the first page of search results. And everyone knows that this has nothing to do with luck or even the how long the website has been around.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your website can be 10 or 15 years old, but never comes up on page one of search results. On the other hand, a one-month old website can very well be rank one in a <a href="/blog/ultimate-guide-for-google-retargeting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">google</a> search result. It all boils down to SEO strategy, and keyword positions is the very first step to an effective SEO strategy. If you know the keywords people use in searching for something, you can create content that is geared towards those keywords.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So how does this relate to you, the owner of a proxy or a batch of proxies? Scraping of keyword positions are done using proxies because people don’t want to use their real IP address when doing this. Keyword positions scraping using a single IP address will get you banned because this involves requesting so much data.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since you own a proxy, you can perform keyword positions scraping and obtain keyword positions and rankings. You can sell this information and believe it or not, this kind of data is worth a lot of money. People and companies actually buy this data to aid in their SEO strategies.</span>

### **3. Run social media campaigns**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1957" src="/assets/Make-Money-04.png" alt="RUN SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media platforms such as <a href="/blog/facebook-ads-in-2018-updates-you-should-not-miss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, <a href="/blog/how-to-boost-your-instagram-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, and <a href="/blog/10-saastr-annual-speakers-to-follow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> had become business platforms as well. Gone are the days when these applications are used for personal journeys only. More and more companies have jumped in the bandwagon that is social media campaign.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To be able to have a lot of engagement, however, you have to post on your account frequently, like 3 to 5 times a day, 7 days a week. Multiple accounts on multiple channels can also help you grow your engagement. The problem is that these <a href="/blog/10-instagram-marketing-tips-for-brands-and-social-media-managers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media websites</a> might ban you if they detect too much activity from one IP address.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram, for example, has set limits. You should not go over 60 follows or unfollows, 60 comments, and 150 Instagram likes every hour. This is pretty much reasonable as no normal person can really like more than 150 posts in an hour.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Proxies, with the help of a software, can help you out with social media campaigns. Since you will be hiding behind different IP addresses, you can create different accounts with the above mentioned social media platforms and start building your social media campaign.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow Liker is one of the most popular software that will work well with your proxies. It allows you to personalize and customize almost all aspect of Pinterest, Instagram, and Twitter.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have your own brand, you can very well make a lot of money as your social media marketing ultimately becomes effective because of a proxy server and the right software.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, radical entrepreneurs can make use of their proxies to offer social media services to other companies.</span>

### **4. Use ScrapeBox**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1958" src="/assets/Make-Money-05.png" alt="USE SCRAPEBOX" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="/blog/best-proxies-for-scrapebox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ScrapeBox</a> is an SEO tool that is a self-declared “Ultimate Link Harvester, Mass WordPress and Movable Type Blog Comment Poster Complete with PR Storm Mode and Bulk Pagerank Checker.” When you use ScrapeBox, you have everything you need to run an effective SEO campaign or strategy. As a matter of fact, it has been dubbed “The Swiss Army Knife of SEO!”      </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Scrapebox is available for $197 and there are times when they run a promotion. As of this writing, they are offering the tool for only $97. Scrapebox only runs on Windows, by the way.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another requirement to use Scrapebox is a proxy or a set of proxies. Since you already have proxies, why not use Scrapebox as well. Your company or brand will be able to generate more leads and convert these leads into sales because of this tool.</span>

### **5. Become a DDoS Tester**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1959" src="/assets/Make-Money-06.png" alt="BECOME A DDOS TESTER" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">DDoS or Distributed Denial of Service have a very bad reputation because it is used by <a href="https://goo.gl/sqh5vw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hackers</a> such as the group Anonymous to shut down government websites and even websites of large corporations and influential individuals. Needless to say, these people are using DDoS illegally, and you should not follow in their footsteps.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So why is DDos included in the tips in making money with proxies? Well, this method can be used legally. You can actually be a DDos tester, offering your services to websites to test the security of their websites. You do need a certain level of coding skills together with your proxies in order to be a DDoS tester, but you will be making a lot of money.</span>

### **6. Setup SSL encryption using reverse proxy**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1960" src="/assets/Make-Money-07.png" alt="SETUP SSL ENCRYPTION USING REVERSE PROXY" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All websites need to have an SSL (Secure Socket Layer) Certificate in order to be considered as a safe and secured website. And each certificate cost a lot of money, mind you. Imagine if someone owns five domains, he or she would have to pay for five separate certificates. So this money-making method entails that you use your proxy to make SSL encryption cheaper for people or companies that have a lot of websites.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reverse proxies protects websites from the blows of attacks, traffic and requests. Clients won’t have to purchase different certificates for each of their website or domain. Rather, your proxy can be the certified site, and all their websites will flow through your proxy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This method will work so much better if you have a number of rotating IP addresses. This way, these websites won’t have to share the same IP address or domain. </span>

### **In Conclusion**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Proxies are great for anonymity while browsing the internet. For sure, nobody will be able to see your identity because you will be hiding behind a dummy IP address. You are totally safe behind a proxy, and we understand that this could be your primary reason for purchasing one or even a batch: anonymity, privacy, and security.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, you can go beyond these things. You can also make money with your proxies, and who wouldn’t want to earn some money? If you are business-minded, then these tips will surely open doors of opportunity for you. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are just 6 ways by which you can make money using your proxies. There are more methods, but most are already either questionable or totally unethical. If you can make money in a legitimate way, then you must do that and avoid being tangled in a complicated situation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although proxies have a bad reputation since they are mostly used in unethical activities, you can still use it in a totally respectable way. Sure, you would need some level of technical expertise and even some coding abilities. Some methods may even take time, and you may need to shell out a specific amount of money. But in the end, you will earn. You may even be able to establish a name for yourself in the field you will choose.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Proxies, like any weapon, can be used in the good and ethical way but it can also be used in a dangerous and compromising way. It all lies with the user, in this case, you. Will you use your proxies ethically? If not, then be ready to face the consequences.      </span>
