<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try searching the <a href="/blog/plugins-can-interfere-online-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet</a> about tips on how to make blog articles and <a href="/blog/how-to-skyrocket-social-media-marketing-efforts-with-proxies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a> posts interesting enough for reader engagement, and you will always see this tip: </span>**include images in your blog articles and social media posts.** <span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you like it or not, images help drive traffic to your <a href="https://www.dnfinder.com/blog/5-tips-keep-hackers-away-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are living in a world where visual impact is very important, primarily because there are just so many people out there who are offering the same things you are offering. Your target market will naturally choose the one that is more attractive to the eyes, and pictures help attract people.</span>

### **Are Free Stock Images Really Free?**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1380" src="/assets/Are-Free-Stock-Images-Really-Free_.png" alt="Ultimate List of Free Stock Images" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Years ago, it was very difficult for website owners to find photos that can be used freely in blog posts and articles. Most sites that offer “free” photos actually require either a link back or a sentence about the rights of using the image. These kinds of pictures do not sound so “free” at all. Totally free photos are those that require </span>**no attribution** <span style="font-weight: 400;">at all.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that the creator or photographer of the image chose the Creative Commons Zero or CC0 license. The creator is waiving all copyrights and other related rights (which includes moral rights, <a href="/blog/how-to-maintain-phone-privacy-get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy</a> rights, database rights, and unfair completion protection rights, among many others). So what does this mean for website owners who use free stock images? For website owners or actually anyone who decides to use free stock photos, this means that:</span>

 <span style="font-weight: 400;">✓ The photos are free for personal and commercial use.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">✓ The photos can be copied, edited, and distributed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">✓ No attribution required so you don’t have to ask permission or link back to the source of the images.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Free stock images are royalty free images and copyright free images, so you really don’t have to worry about anything at all. However, there may be free stock images website that allows you to download a limited number of photos at a time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If these websites detect that the number of images you are downloading is beyond the limit, then they can actually ban your <a href="/blog/rotate-ip-address/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP address</a>. For such instances, you can actually use <a href="/blog/how-developers-use-premium-proxies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proxies</a> in order to avoid getting banned from the website. Connecting to proxy servers allows you to choose an <a href="/blog/how-to-hide-my-public-ip-address/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP address</a> that will mask or hide your real one. Even when the dummy IP address gets banned for downloading so many free stock photos, you can still use another IP address to download another batch of royalty free photos.</span>

### **Where Can I Get Free Stock Images?**
