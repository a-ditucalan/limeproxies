If you’re familiar with the world of proxies enough, you know the **difference between public proxies and private proxies, free proxies and paid proxies, and residential proxies and data-center proxies.** If you’re not familiar with it, you can visit this link  [learn more ](http://limeproxies.com/blog/free-proxy-vs-paid-proxy-paid-proxies-better-free-proxies/)

  Here we will mainly deal with the differences between residential proxies and data-center proxies. You might have seen certain providers that boast of having 100% residential IP addresses. This may be what made you curious to find out about the difference between the two.

  <strong>What makes residential proxies better than the corporate data-center proxies?</strong>
</h3>

**Let’s first find out what a residential IP proxy is.**

In a residential proxy, the <a href="/blog/rotate-ip-address/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP address</a> comes from the Internet Service Provider (ISP) of the host. The proxy provider will connect you to its ISP and lend you its IP address. This works on the basic principle of IP address allocation. When you’re connected to the internet you have an IP address that is given to you by an ISP. Your IP address says a lot about you including your location on the map, your ISP provider etc. When you’re on a residential proxy, you’re borrowing these details of your proxy provider. In a way, the proxy provider is also connecting you to the internet now.

### **How is the data-center proxy different then?**

Well, a data-center proxy doesn’t connect you to the <a href="/blog/how-to-speed-up-your-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet</a>. These proxies work on a different principle. They don’t lend out their own IP addresses for you to borrow and impersonate while browsing the web. Instead, they work by hiding your own IP addresses from the internet. So websites like [www.whatismyipaddress.com](http://www.whatismyipaddress.com) are unable to locate you or find any information on you. Data-center use proxy providers whose services the users pay for. These are few number of proxy providers which the data-center keeps rotating (rotating proxies). This means that while browsing the web in any given month, the user could have assumed the IP address of over 10 different locations, keeping them anonymous. So in data-center proxy, unlike residential proxy, uses the user’s ISP to connect to the internet and mask the IP address.

While asking the question which is better – residential proxy or data-center proxy, it is important to note that residential proxy are from the ISP and data-center proxy are a secondary source. Let’s see how this can be a problem in a technology-laden world.

When it comes to large internet companies (like <a href="/blog/latest-seo-trends-and-google-algorithm-update-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a>, <a href="/blog/how-to-stream-netflix-and-youtube-from-any-country-using-proxies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a>, <a href="/blog/facebook-ads-in-2018-updates-you-should-not-miss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> etc) locating proxy being used and blocking those IP addresses,<a href="https://cccleanindiana.com/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #333333;">cccleanindiana.com/</a>, data-center proxies come first in that list. The malice behind the intent of data-center proxies is suspected and hunted down. **Since proxies are used systematically to scrape information, spam websites and other dangerous activities, this is understandable**.

Corporations believe that people using residential proxies are usual, everyday individuals browsing the web in a casual manner since they seem like genuine IP addresses.  They can pass through the radars of the companies on a look out for proxies in order to eliminate them. This is not to say that data-center proxies are not in use. They are used in the millions everyday by people all around the world. But they also stand higher chances of detection of the IP address and being banned from essential websites.

### **DATA CENTER PROXIES HAVE HIGHER RATES OF IP DETECTION & ARE BANNED**

How can you be wary of the proxy providers that are prone to being banned? One wait is by looking up their provider name on the form. If it is a country based ISP like Airtel or AT&T, then the chances are lower of the company banning the IP addresses. But if the provider is a corporation in a data-center, it is quite prone to being banned.

People **using proxy for anonymity and safety** and to avoid being banned by Google, like for the use of [**SEO or online marketing**,](http://limeproxies.com/blog/proxies-for-seo/) they want to have a lesser chance of arising any suspicion. If they don’t want to be blacklisted, residential proxy seems like an obvious answer. If you want to appear like a normal user of the internet of your desired location without arising suspicion, the safer route is to don the IP addresses of the desired location instead of **hiding your IP address** altogether. But this can be tricky when your ISP is also bewaring and will observe any discrepancies.

But in the current climate, it is difficult to tell which one is a real residential proxy and which one is a data-center proxy because the latter often sell themselves as residential proxies due to some latent trust in them. Residential proxies sometimes claim to distribute proxies instead of VPN, but their legitimacy is also up in the air and hidden behind a wall of tech. It is hard to tell if a provider is really selling you a residential local connection or if it is just a data-center hiding some details and aspects of their location. Every proxy that you use will require a huge amount of research to know its legitimacy in terms of being residential or data-center. However**, an elite private proxy used correctly will provide the same security anonymity and efficiency.** Hence, eliminating the need for specialized, over- priced residential proxies which sometimes can go as high as $50/month. These proxies still don’t guarantee a real residential proxy which is not being breached for profitable data-center work on the side. Corporations have a way of making arrangements with the ISP and deluding the users. These often use their access for data harvesting and creating dubious botnets.

The two serve the same purpose – this much is clear. Most [proxy providers](http://www.limeproxies.com/) offer the same advice – if you are to use an **elite proxy** with care and caution you won’t have to worry about it being residential or data-center. The main concern is about being detected by Google and being banned, in which case having an **elite private proxy** comes in handy. One of the long standing brands is LimeProxies. It is a private proxy which offers its transparent services at low prices.
