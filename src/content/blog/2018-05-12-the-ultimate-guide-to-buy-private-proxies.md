<span style="font-weight: 400;">Proxies are a great tool to enhance <a href="/blog/internet-things-technology-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet</a> users’ <a href="/blog/plugins-can-interfere-online-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security</a> and <a href="/blog/how-to-maintain-phone-privacy-get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy</a>. When proxies first emerged, it was viewed in a negative light as some thought that it was used only by people hiding their suspicious and even criminal acts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the emergence of crimes against the privacy and security of internet users, proxies have become more and more utilized as a tool against these crimes. The crimes we are talking about are the likes of <a href="/blog/end-user-devices-get-hacked-8-easy-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hacking</a>, identity theft, and <a href="/blog/web-remains-primary-ransomware-vector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ransomware</a>. These involve people <a href="https://goo.gl/73p9Ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tracking</a> your internet activities and getting your personal information such as your name, physical address, <a href="/blog/rotate-ip-address/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP</a> and MAC address, and even your credit card information.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even advertisers have found a way into your computers as they deploy trackers that can somehow gather and even analyze your <a href="/blog/can-protect-online-life-travelling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online</a> activities. They can even know the size of your computer screen, the type of device you are using, what websites you are <a href="/blog/access-blocked-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accessing</a>, how long you spend on a single web page and much more.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are one of the thousands of internet users that do not want anyone to track your online activities, then proxies are very useful for you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Proxies work by connecting you to a server before you connect to a website. This way, the proxy server will be hiding your real identity. Your <a href="/blog/how-to-hide-my-public-ip-address/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP address</a> will be masked by the proxy IP address, thereby making it impossible for anyone – advertisers, criminals, stalkers, and even your internet service provider – to know what you are doing online.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to buy private proxies, this article can guide you in choosing which proxy provider is suitable for your needs. Below are a few tips that will help you in your quest to buy <a href="/blog/how-to-use-google-as-proxy-server/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proxy server</a>.</span>

## **Free or Paid Proxies?**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1577" src="/assets/Free-or-Paid-01.png" alt="Guide to Buy Private Proxies - Free or Paid" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone wants free service, of course. But in this day and age, is anything still for free? Getting a free proxy service for instance, is not totally free at all. Yes, you might not be paying a monthly service fee, and you might not shell out any amount of money when using the service.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, these free proxy providers can inject trackers into your computers. They can actually track and record your online activities, and that is the real cost of getting their “free” service.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, these <a href="/blog/things-need-know-choosing-free-proxies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free proxy</a> service providers may very well be doing what proxies were supposed to protect you from. Instead of giving you <a href="https://goo.gl/AmHpKX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anonymity</a>, these providers are the ones who are violating your <a href="/blog/how-to-maintain-phone-privacy-get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is sad but actually true. Therefore, it is safer to buy a <a href="/blog/use-private-proxies-vpn-simultaneously/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">private proxy</a>, if only for the reliability and security it provides. Proxies don’t have to be overly expensive though. A moderately priced subscription works just as well as the expensive ones.</span>

## **What to Consider In Buying Proxies**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So we have that “free versus paid” issue settled, let us look at the things you have to consider in choosing a proxy service provider. Google “proxy service” and you will get hundreds of results which will leave you confused. How do you choose a proxy service provider? Read on to find out.</span>

### **Security and Reliability**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1578" src="/assets/Security-01.png" alt="security and Reliability" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://goo.gl/4AiSqG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Security</a> is on top of our list of criteria because this has been the primary reason why proxies exist at all. Proxies should provide security so that you can browse online without having to worry about someone else virtually watching over your shoulders.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your private proxy provider should also be reliable, which means that the service can be trusted and is available 24/7. Security and reliability can be partially assessed by going through the feedback or reviews of a particular proxy provider.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The more positive reviews, the better the service. Therefore, take time to research your options and make sure to read the comments section!</span>

### **Speed**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a minimal amount of trade-off with speed when you connect to a website through a proxy. This is because there is already a third party involved, thereby lengthening the connection process by milliseconds.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although, there is a change in speed when connecting via a private proxy, the change is minimal and is worth the security and reliability that comes with it. If for some reason the connection is really low, make sure that your network speed is not at fault. You may need to contact your internet service provider in this case.</span>

### **Server Location**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1579" src="/assets/Server-Location-01.png" alt="server locations" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The speed of connection is also dependent on the location of the proxy servers. The nearer the proxy to the server of the webpage, the faster the connection will be. Also, there are websites that only allow IP addresses from certain countries. This is called <a href="https://goo.gl/NBw7G9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">geo blocking or geo restriction</a>, and this has been used by large companies such as Netflix, YouTube, CBS, NBA, and other popular video <a href="/blog/how-to-stream-netflix-and-youtube-from-any-country-using-proxies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streaming</a> platforms.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, you have to make sure that you buy private proxies from a provider that has servers in the countries or locations that are close to the websites you are accessing.</span>

### **Customer Service**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The security, reliability, speed, and location of their servers will be all for nothing if the proxy provider’s customer service is poor. You won’t be able to get answers to your questions in a timely manner, or worse, you won’t get any answer at all.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="/blog/a-guide-on-customer-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Customer</a> support is very important especially because you will be dealing with some technical stuff when setting up the private proxies. Choose a proxy server provider that has decent customer service. A decent customer support replies to queries in a timely manner, and has different ways by which customers can contact them.</span>
