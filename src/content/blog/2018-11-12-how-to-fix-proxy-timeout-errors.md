<span style="font-weight: 400;">One fine day you were browsing the <a href="blog/how-to-speed-up-your-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet</a> seamlessly, but from nowhere you got an error message saying for some reason, your proxy has timed out. Ever happened to you? I could hear you saying a big YES.  Not everyone knows what happened and what the error indicates. But, one thing is unfortunately guaranteed with this event; you won&#8217;t be able to use the internet via proxy any further until the issue is fixed. It is actually very irritating to get such errors when everything was running smooth. It often leads to time and capital loss. And if you are someone whose business runs over proxies, then it is not less than a nightmare for you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t need to worry about it, as we know the possible reasons, as well as effective solutions. Rest assured, you will be able to fix the proxy <a href="/blog/how-to-fix-504-gateway-timeout-error/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timeout</a> error by the end of this article.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we move further to the core of this article, below is the explanation of the few technical terms which is going to be used frequently in this article.</span>

**1. Proxy server:** <span style="font-weight: 400;">A <a href="blog/what-is-proxy-server-and-how-it-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proxy server</a> is actually an intermediate channel often known as a gateway between the normal users (client) and the internet(server). Proxy servers provide many functionalities, including security, and privacy. It actually depends on how you are using the proxy, and the security and privacy level you need for your purpose.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Proxy servers also act as a firewall and web filter, and in some cases, it also caches data to speed up connection and webpage loading.</span>

**2. Error codes:** <span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever we try accessing a web server or a web application, we send an HTTP request that is received by a server and acknowledged with another HTTP status code. HTTP status codes are of five types and are written in the form of three-digit. The first digit is enough to get an idea about which group the particular response belongs to. Below is the list of the groups with an ample explanation : </span>

**A**. **1_ _: Informational  :-** <span style="font-weight: 400;">It means the client request has been received by the server and is under process.</span>

**B. 2_ _: Success :-** <span style="font-weight: 400;">It means the client request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.</span>

**C. 3_ _: Redirection :-** <span style="font-weight: 400;">It means further step must be practiced in order to execute the request.</span>

**D. 4_ _: Client Error :-** <span style="font-weight: 400;">It indicates that the error is at the client end.</span>

**E. 5_ _: Server Error :-** <span style="font-weight: 400;">It indicates that the error is at the server end.</span>

**3. IP address:** <span style="font-weight: 400;">An <a href="/blog/how-to-renew-ip-address-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP address</a> is a logical address which is configured on a device (which can communicate in a computer network) so that the device can be uniquely identified in a network.  Currently, two versions of IP address are available. First one and the older one is IPv4 (IPv4 is a 32-bit address, the total number of possible IPv4 addresses is 2^32 addresses i.e around 4 billion addresses). The second one and the latest one is  IPv6(IPv6 is a 128-bit address, the total number of possible IpV4 addresses is 2^128 addresses).</span>

### **Below are the few points you should know before we discuss fixing the proxy timeout error:**

#### <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2938" src="/assets/Timeout-Error-01.png" alt="Proxy Timeout" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every system in a computer network has a unique IP address. No two end devices can have the same IP address in the same computer network. The Internet is smart enough and it knows how to send the correct data packet to the correct computer on the basis of the IP address.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A proxy server is basically a computer(server) on the internet with its own IP address (which could be multiple in number) that your computer knows. When you initiate a web request, your request goes to the proxy server first. The proxy server then forwards your web request on your behalf to the web server, and then revert back the response from the web server to your computer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While forwarding the request the proxy server can make changes (if it is configured in such a way) to the data packets you send. For example, a  proxy server can mask your IP address, so the web server doesn’t know exactly where you are in the world. It can also encrypt your data, to prevent your data from getting intercepted by any hacker. It can also act as a firewall by blocking and allowing certain inbound and outbound traffic as per the requirement. </span>

#### **For what purpose people use proxies?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are a few reasons out of several reasons why organizations and individuals use proxies:-</span>

  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">From a common parent to the managers of big companies use proxies to keep a track of internet usage of children and employees respectively. They set the proxy server in such a way that they can monitor how their employees or kids use the internet. They also use the proxy server to block certain websites which they don&#8217;t want to be seen by their employees or children.</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">A proxy server is also used to reduce bandwidth consumption and improving the overall network speed. They achieve it by using proxy servers to cache (save a copy of the website locally) all or frequently visited websites, so when you or anyone else in the same network demands for the same website it can be served from the same local cache. And also when many people in the network send out the request for a website from the same proxy server, the proxy server on their behalf sends out only one request to the respective website. This also helps in saving bandwidth and improving the overall network performance.</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals and organizations similarly use proxy servers to browse the internet more privately. Which means the destination server will not get to know who&#8217;s the man behind the curtain who made the original request, some use it to hide browsing history.</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with a great privacy, proxy servers provide security too. Proxy servers are sometimes configured to encrypt your web requests so that it doesn&#8217;t get intercepted by hackers. You can also blacklist malicious websites on the server level to prevent access to it. </span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">Proxy servers are also used to bypass geo-restricted websites. Let us make it more clear to you with an example: suppose there is a website which shows Geo-based TV-series and you are in Singapore but you want to see content being displayed in the US. In this case, you may use a proxy to change your location and watch those otherwise restricted shows.</span>

#### <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2937" src="/assets/Timeout-Error-02.png" alt="Proxy Timeout" width="720" height="361" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When a server takes a long time to acknowledge a request made from a client (web browser) or another server, the proxy timeout error occurs. The device that made the request on the very first place doesn&#8217;t wait for any response after timeout time is over. This is done to prevent you from ideally waiting for a page or application that is not going to come up. </span>

#### **When do we say that a proxy Timed Out?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As discussed above if a proxy is used, it acts as an interface between the client and the web browsers and applications. Proxy act as a middle point of the communication link. It does this by sending and receiving data requests. Whenever a server or a browser sends out a request, it waits for a pre-decided amount of time to get a response from the web server. If it doesn’t receive any acknowledgment after the pre-decided amount of time, it times out. The proxy timeout time depends on the web browser that you are using.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, timeouts are really very irritating. But, it is actually very good that they happen. Otherwise, you will have no idea whether the page or application will load or not, all you have will be a blank screen with infinite validity. Anyways a clear rejection is always better than a fake promise. No one would like staring a blank screen instead of their desired page or a timeout error. </span>

#### **Possible reasons behind the proxy timeout error:**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After understanding what exactly proxy timeout error is, you will certainly be curious to know why it occurs. It’s important to understand how they are generated before we start fixing the issue. As a clear understanding of the issue always helps in a quick fix. So, here we are to discuss the possible reasons behind the proxy timeout error.</span>

  * **Server Issues:**<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Sometimes the web server has a very low technical configuration ( Ram, hard disk, processor and many other vital components of less capacity or bad quality). Also, when the technical configuration is good, it is not optimized properly which creates performance issues which finally leads to timeout errors. In such cases, you should upgrade your hosting plan. If you are already on a good plan, ask your hosting provider to check and provide the reason for high resource utilization or to upgrade their server. </span>
  * **Network issues:–** <span style="font-weight: 400;">If the network link between the intermediate proxy server and the web server is weak, it will create a considerable lag between HTTP/HTTPS request and response and will produce timeout errors.You need to perform a quick network diagnostic test to see if your internet connection is up and running. </span>
  * **DNS settings:–** <span style="font-weight: 400;">If the DNS(Domain name server) is not configured properly for the domain, there will be a problem in resolving the domain name to IP address, which our browser needs to query web pages from the web server. which can produce timeout errors.</span>
  * **Browser settings: –** <span style="font-weight: 400;">If the browser settings are not correctly configured, it can produce connectivity problems in initiating a connection to the web server.</span>
  * **Website is unavailable:- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes the proxy timeouts not because of an issue with the proxy. It can also happen when the website you are trying to access is down for some of the other reasons. In such cases try loading a different website. It indicates that there is no issue with the proxy if you are able to load another website without any problem.</span>**
  * **Proxy server issue**<span style="font-weight: 400;">:- If all the connection request is going through the proxy server and the timeout value set on the proxy server is very short, it will frequently produce timeout errors.</span>
  * **Firewall misconfiguration:–** <span style="font-weight: 400;">The web server firewall has a set of rules to control inbound as well as outbound traffic, using these rules you can allow or restrict connections to the web server. If the firewall is not configured properly or if a rule is set to restrict the connection to the server, it will produce timeout errors.</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">It could be an issue with ISP.</span>

#### <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2936" src="/assets/Timeout-Error-03.png" alt="Proxy Timeout" width="720" height="361" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we know what is proxy timeout error. We also know the possible reasons behind proxy timeout error. Before we dive in deeper towards the fixing techniques, there are a few things which are worth trying and which may fix the issue without doing a lot. </span>

**Few easy steps:-**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Try refreshing the website or the application.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Check firewall rules.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Try restarting the network. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Cross-check the proxy server settings in the browser or application are correct or not.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Try loading the website in a different browser.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Try loading the website in incognito mode.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Try to force refresh the webpage to clear your website’s cache. Sometimes the issue is due to stored cache in your system.</span>

> _<span style="font-weight: 400;">You must be wondering what is &#8220;force refresh&#8221;? It is not that complicated as it sounds. With an intention to speed up web browsing, web browsers are made in a way to download frequently visited web pages locally on your computer which is termed as browser cache. Browser cache holds almost everything you have seen or downloaded while browsing. So when you visit the same page again, it reduces the wait time by loading the page from locally stored cache also helps in reducing bandwidth consumption.</span>_

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your operating system you need to do hit following key combination while being on the browser.</span>

**Windows: Ctrl + F5**

**Mac/Apple: Apple + R or command + R**

**Linux: F5**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">8. If force  refreshing doesn&#8217;t help, you should try flushing your DNS(domain name system) cache.</span>

**For Windows:-** <span style="font-weight: 400;">Press the Windows+R key combination in order to open the Run dialog box. Type cmd and click the OK button.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A command prompt will appear, type &#8220;ipconfig /flushdns&#8221; and press enter button.</span>

**For Linux:-** <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Open terminal and type &#8220;sudo /etc/init.d/nscd restart&#8221; and press enter button.</span>

**For MacOS:-** <span style="font-weight: 400;">Open terminal and type &#8220;sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder&#8221; and press enter button. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">***Please note that these commands may change with time.***</span>

### **Time to follow pro-steps**

#### **1. Proxy settings issue**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To make sure that the timeout errors are appearing because of the proxy servers, not because of the web server, you need to check proxy settings on your client system. First, we need to check whether the proxy is configured on the browser level or the system level (using applications like Proxifier).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, here are the steps to check proxy settings for chrome browser:-</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://settings/</span>

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2919" src="/assets/1.png" alt="Proxy Timeout" width="720" height="323" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Search for Proxy and click on “Open Proxy Settings”</span>

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2920" src="/assets/2.png" alt="Proxy Timeout" width="720" height="432" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Within the Connections tab, click LAN Settings</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2921" src="/assets/3.png" alt="Proxy Timeout" width="405" height="528" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Untick the options that show &#8220;Automatically detect settings&#8221; and &#8220;Use a proxy server for your LAN&#8221; if either of them is enabled.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2922" src="/assets/4.png" alt="Proxy Timeout" width="410" height="384" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Steps to check proxy settings for Mozilla firefox browser:-</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Open your Mozilla browser and click on “Options” available on the top right corner.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2923" src="/assets/5.png" alt="Proxy Timeout" width="720" height="342" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Scroll down to the bottom and click on “Settings”</span>

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2924" src="/assets/6.png" alt="Proxy Timeout" width="720" height="367" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Select “no proxy” option on the top.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2925" src="/assets/7.png" alt="Proxy Timeout" width="720" height="364" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Steps to check proxy settings for MAC:-</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">a. In your Apple menu, click on “System Preferences” and then click on Network.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2926" src="/assets/8.png" alt="Proxy Timeout" width="991" height="578" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Select the network service you use in the list — for example, Ethernet or Wi-Fi.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Click Advanced, then click Proxies.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2927" src="/assets/9.png" alt="Proxy Timeout" width="693" height="577" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Uncheck any checked field.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2928" src="/assets/10.png" alt="Proxy Timeout" width="777" height="618" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If disabling the proxies resolve the issue of timeout errors then the problem was with the proxies. Please cross check your proxy settings or else contact your proxy provider.</span>

#### **2. Keep your web browsers updated**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can try updating your web browsers(if you are not having the latest one). It is recommended to keep your web browsers updated not only to get the latest features but also because sometimes an outdated web browser can throw proxy timeout error while you are trying to connect to a website.  If you are still getting a proxy timeout error, uninstall the browser, remove all the related and cached files. You need to make sure perform the reboot of your system before installing the latest one. This will fix the issue or will lead us to the conclusion that there are not any problems with your browser. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To make this point 100% sure try using different browsers before you move to another technique.</span>

#### **3. Use different DNS Server**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By default, the DNS servers are configured as per the ISP&#8217;s DNS server. But, a good practice is to replace the ISP&#8217;s DNS with public  DNS services like Google DNS, Cloudflare privacy-focused DNS, Cisco’s OpenDNS. These DNS servers keep updating their DNS records periodically.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For Example: Changing DNS server settings on Windows 7(By Google)</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to the Control Panel.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Click Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings.</span>
</li>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2929" src="/assets/11.png" alt="Proxy Timeout" width="993" height="558" />

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2930" src="/assets/12.png" alt="Proxy Timeout" width="990" height="559" />

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Select the connection for which you want to configure Google Public DNS. For example:</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">1. To change the settings for an Ethernet connection, right-click Local Area            Connection > Properties.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">2. To change the settings for a wireless connection, right-click Wireless Network Connection > Properties.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">3. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2931" src="/assets/13.png" alt="" width="996" height="564" />

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Select the Networking tab. Under This connection uses the following items, select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) and then click Properties.</span>
</li>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2932" src="/assets/14.png" alt="Proxy Timeout" width="398" height="498" />

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Select Use the following DNS server addresses. If there are any IP addresses listed in the Preferred DNS server or Alternate DNS server, write them down for future reference.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Replace those addresses with the IP addresses of the Google DNS servers:</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">For IPv4: 8.8.8.8 and/or 8.8.4.4.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">For IPv6: 2001:4860:4860::8888 and/or 2001:4860:4860::8844.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">For IPv6-only: you can use Google Public DNS64 instead of the IPv6 addresses in the previous point.</span>
</li>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2933" src="/assets/15.png" alt="Proxy Timeout" width="452" height="489" />

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Restart the connection you selected in step 3.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Test that your setup is working correctly.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Repeat the procedure for additional network connections you want to change.</span>
</li>

For changing DNS of other operating system with Google, please visit this <a style="font-size: 1.6em;" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using">link</a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, you can find the setup steps for several DNS services on their official websites if you want to change the DNS servers of your network. It is highly recommended to replace your ISP&#8217;s DNS entry with a public DNS.</span>

#### **4. Antivirus program**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An antivirus software, as we all know is a program that safeguards your system from malicious files and computer viruses. Most of us are already using it for a long time(use one if you are not using any). It has the ability to stop you from accessing a website while using a proxy in order to protect your computer from all those bad viruses. Antivirus programs do not want to ruin your web browsing experience, but they keep on adding good proxy websites to their blacklist, and you can not bypass your own antivirus which is protecting you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Disabling your antivirus to use websites through proxies may sound cool in a short run. But leaving your system open to all the viruses and malware who are already waiting for this opportunity to harm your computer and to invade your privacy is not a good deal.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try looking for an antivirus program which can be configured along with the proxy.</span>

#### **5. DNS Propagation**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After changing DNS settings for a domain, we need to wait for a few hours for the DNS records to get updated, the technical term for this procedure is DNS propagation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is, the IP-Hostname table within the Domain Name System (DNS) is not updated instantly. It takes time for new domain registrations to propagate across the network. Practically, it can take a few hours for your domain to update its existence globally on every DNS servers to become accessible. You are always suggested to wait for at least 48 hours before contacting registrars, as you will get the same answer from them if you contact them before 48 hours. They always want to be on the safe side because in some cases it takes around 48 hours.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are very curious to know about the propagation status, you may use browser-based tools like DNS Propagation checker like </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">DNS leaf</span>][1]<span style="font-weight: 400;">. If it shows no error or just a couple of failures you should proceed with the solution given below. If it shows many false results then you need to wait for the DNS propagation to complete.</span>

#### **6. Check if the server is too occupied to handle the request**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Servers also give timeout errors if there is a sudden load hike on the server due to heavy traffic, sometimes it also happens due to DDoS(Distributed denial of service) attack. Change the servers IP temporarily if it is a DDoS attack.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes proxy timeout error can appear when the website or the shared server on which your website is present is getting spammed using some malicious application also known as bots, which has the capability to flood your website with an abnormal number of requests per second, which can never be generated by humans and also cannot be served by our websites.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can check the access logs of your websites and of the server too(if the server is dedicated to you). You will surely get some regular pattern of requests from the same IP or many IPs of the same subnet which will guide you to the culprits IP. You may also ask your hosting provider to block the IP or the complete subnet from which the unusual traffic is coming from.</span>

#### **7. Get rid of unused Add-Ons**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you someone who keeps on adding Add-Ons and never uses most of them? If yes, then be informed that high numbers of Add-Ons can make your system extremely slow and will often lead to proxy timeout. It&#8217;s better to get rid of unused Add-Ons. Removing unused proxies is still a good practice even if it is not able to fix proxy timeouts, as it will surely boost up your system speed.</span>

#### **8. Issue with WordPress Plugins**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress is developed using PHP (&#8220;Hypertext Preprocessor&#8221;, earlier it was known as &#8220;Personal Home Page&#8221;) all the plugins which work with WordPress are also designed in PHP to avoid compatibility issues. Unfortunately, there is one well-known issue with this one of the leading name in the world of CMS (content management system), it can only manage a limited number of requests. If a plugin is being used which is creating request more than limit which can&#8217;t be technically served will result in  proxy timeout error.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The real plugin causing the issue can be found by disabling the plugins one by one until the error stops, it is more like a hit and trial method. </span>

#### **9. Script bugs can cause timeout errors**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If proper coding is not done within the application, it can produce proxy timeout errors. You can try locating the dirty code in your application by manually debugging it. You may also need to check the application logs, logs will surely guide you to the dirty code. Testing the application on a local machine in a private network is the best you can do without affecting the real code,  you will surely get the dirty code causing the issue. You should use two different screens while testing the code, first for the testing and second for watching the real-time logs.</span>

#### **10. Buy good proxies from [Limeproxies][2]**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes we keep running around troubleshooting all the possibilities but we forget to check our core element that is proxy itself. You will keep on receiving the proxy timeout error if you are using low-quality proxies. There are many types of proxies available in the market.  Let&#8217;s discuss it on a general level:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">a. <strong>Free Proxies</strong>:- These type of proxies are free and are available for everyone. You have no idea how many countless people from around the globe are sharing the same proxies for different purposes these gives a clear idea that such proxies can give huge timeouts due to heavy load on it. Not only timeouts there are some disguised security as well as privacy threat linked with these type of proxies.
