The game, however, was made available as Animation series, Card games, Comics and Board games. In 2018, Jasco Games inaugurated the Kickstarter Campaign for Miniature games on Street Fighter.

## 2. Doom

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2830" src="/assets/Doom.jpg" alt="doom" width="720" height="439" />

Doom is a first-person shooting game which was released in 2016 and was developed by iD Software and marketed by Bethesda Softworks. This game is very famous around the world, the game is available on Windows, PS4 and Xbox One. However, there was news that it was released on Nintendo switch in November 2017 by Panic Button.

Going back to time, Doom was available as a video game with the name Doom3 which was released in 2004. Doom is an upgraded version and the first main installment in Doom 3 series with 3 other versions. Losing its fame around 2006-2010, Doom was back in 2014 as just Doom with more graphics, designs and a different build which was tested by customers or rather gamers who had pre-orders on the same.

In all the platforms except the Nintendo, Doom has a built-in “ level creation tool” named as &#8220;SnapMap&#8221; which allows all the players to create as well as edit maps with their own strategy and logic. With SnapMap, players can design their own maps for different modes, from single-player levels to multiplayer level maps. When players are designing a level, the game will shift to a horizontal view. Players can place sections to form a level and connect with each other. If they are not connected together, the color of the construction pieces changes to notify every player.

Players can make use of the X-ray camera which removes all the walls to allow players to view the objects inside. Players can also place enemies into their maps, with the exception of the campaign&#8217;s bosses. Their artificial intelligence and the player&#8217;s own movement speed can also be changed as per the need. Players can also include additional lighting effects and other gameplay mods such as health packs and ammunition boost. Only in-game options can be used, and players cannot create or import their own options or mods into the game. Levels can also be tested before they are published online. This is one advantage that makes Doom stand out.

Dota 2 is played as matches by two teams of five players, with each team acquiring and defending a specific base on the map. Each of the ten players represents a powerful character, also termed as a &#8220;hero&#8221;, per the game language and they have unique abilities and with each one having a differing style of play.

The team which destroys the largest structure of the opponent team’s base normally called as “ Ancient “ ( on which the title is based) will be the winner and will be carrying huge number of experience points and tools for the “ Hero” character.

The development of this version of the game began in 2009 after the developer of the predecessor DOTA was hired by Valve Corporation to enhance the game experience of the next version with mods and a different build i.e on a Source Game Engine. The game was released 4 years later in 2013 on three platforms i.e Windows, Linux and OS X, however, the Beta version for the game was made available to the public in 2011 at Gamescom along with “ The International “ inaugural event which is an eSport gaming event.

For the standard official series sponsored or organised by iRacing, each year is divided into four seasons of 12 weeks each, with all the sessions in a series held on one track for each week during the 12-week season. Drivers can take part in practice sessions, qualifying level sessions and actual race sessions.

The service also promises to provide regular updates between the 12-week competition seasons.
