<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you a <a href="/blog/top-10-reasons-why-do-gamers-use-gaming-proxies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gamer</a>? If yes, then you must be knowing Steam? But, do you know how can you use Steam on a  Proxy Network? Let us discuss Steam before we discuss using Steam on a Proxy Network. Steam is basically a digital sharing platform dedicated to gaming. It is developed by Valve Corporation. The main services provided by steam are purchasing and playing <a href="/blog/top-5-ways-to-get-paid-to-play-video-games-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video games</a>. Along with that Steam also offers digital rights management (DRM), video streaming, and social networking services. Below are some other features provided by Steam:</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide installation guides.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Provides a multiplayer gaming platform.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Games are always updated with the latest version.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Steam has Steam Cloud which provides an easy and transparent remote file storage system for your game which autosaves everything after the game exits..</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Voice and text chat can be done while playing.</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Operating Systems Supported By Steam are as follows:</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, or later.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mac, OS X version 10.11 (El Capitan), or later.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ubuntu Linux (latest version).</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaming Consoles</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Smartphones (Android, ios and windows)</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can purchase games and other steam services through their digital store present in the steam client interface called the Steam Store. Once you buy the game a digital license will be attached to your Steam account, so that you will be able to download the software on any compatible device. Games are stored on the network of servers which are globally distributed. You can download them using a Steam proprietary file transfer protocol. Steam deals in almost all of the common currencies such as US dollars, Canadian dollars, euros, pounds sterling, Brazilian reais, Russian rubles, Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupees depending on the users geo-location.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we move further to the core of this article, below is the explanation of the few technical terms which is going to be used frequently in this article.</span>

**1. Proxy server:** <span style="font-weight: 400;">A <a href="/blog/what-is-proxy-server-and-how-it-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proxy server</a> is actually an intermediate channel often known as a gateway between the normal users (client) and the internet(server). Proxy servers provide many functionalities, including security, and privacy. It actually depends on how you are using the proxy, and the security and privacy level you need for your purpose.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Proxy servers also act as a firewall and web filter, and in some cases, it also caches data to speed up connection and webpage loading.</span>

**2. IP address:** <span style="font-weight: 400;">An <a href="/blog/how-to-renew-ip-address-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP address</a> is a logical address which is configured on a device (which can communicate in a computer network) so that the device can be uniquely identified in a network.  Currently, two versions of IP address are available. First one and the older one is IPv4 (IPv4 is a 32-bit address, the total number of possible IPv4 addresses is 2^32 addresses i.e around 4 billion addresses). The second one and the latest one is  IPv6(IPv6 is a 128-bit address, the total number of possible IpV4 addresses is 2^128 addresses).</span>

### **Below are the few points you should know before we discuss using Steam on a proxy network :**

#### **Working of Proxy Network:**

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2999" src="/assets/Steam-Proxy-01-2.png" alt="steam on a proxy network" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every system in a computer network has a unique IP address. No two end devices can have the same IP address in the same computer network. The Internet is smart enough and it knows how to send the correct data packet to the correct computer on the basis of the IP address.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A proxy server is basically a computer(server) on the internet with its own IP address (which could be multiple in number) that your computer knows. When you initiate a web request, your request goes to the proxy server first. The proxy server then forwards your web request on your behalf to the web server, and then revert back the response from the web server to your computer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While forwarding the request the proxy server can make changes (if it is configured in such a way) to the data packets you send. For example, a  proxy server can mask your IP address, so the web server doesn’t know exactly where you are in the world. It can also encrypt your data, to prevent your data from getting intercepted by any hacker. It can also act as a firewall by blocking and allowing certain inbound and outbound traffic as per the requirement. </span>

#### **For what reasons do people use Proxies?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are a few reasons out of several reasons why organizations and individuals use proxies:-</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">From a common parent to the managers of big companies use proxies to keep a track of internet usage of children and employees respectively. They set the proxy server in such a way that they can monitor how their employees or kids use the internet. They also use the proxy server to block certain websites which they don&#8217;t want to be seen by their employees or children.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">A proxy server is also used to reduce bandwidth consumption and improving the overall network speed. They achieve it by using proxy servers to cache (save a copy of the website locally) all or frequently visited websites, so when you or anyone else in the same network demands for the same website it can be served from the same local cache. And also when many people in the network send out the request for a website from the same proxy server, the proxy server on their behalf sends out only one request to the respective website. This also helps in saving bandwidth and improving the overall network performance.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals and organizations similarly use proxy servers to browse the internet more privately. Which means the destination server will not get to know who&#8217;s the man behind the curtain who made the original request, some use it to hide browsing history.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with a great privacy, proxy servers provide security too. Proxy servers are sometimes configured to encrypt your web requests so that it doesn&#8217;t get intercepted by hackers. You can also blacklist malicious websites on the server level to prevent access to it. </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Proxy servers are also used to bypass geo-restricted websites. Let us make it more clear to you with an example: suppose there is a website which shows Geo-based TV-series and you are in Singapore but you want to see content being displayed in the US. In this case, you may use a proxy to change your location and watch those otherwise restricted shows.</span>
</li>

&nbsp;

### **Why do anyone will need a Proxy Network along with Steam, when they can run Steam without a Proxy Network?**

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3000" src="/assets/Steam-Proxy-02.png" alt="steam on a proxy network" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three main reasons why someone will want to use a proxy network along with Steam. In the first case, you need proxy just because you want to access Steam in an area or in a network which is not allowing you to access Steam services normally, or they might have intentionally blocked it in the network. Schools and workplaces for most of the times block such services in their network so that it could not be reached by kids in school or employees in the workplace for justified reasons. This restriction falls under a category which has nothing to do with restrictions imposed by Steam, as they are not the people restricting you. Anyway, our main concern is not to find; who is responsible for this restriction? But, we are the victim here and we need to find a workaround to tackle this restriction. This is one of the three scenarios where we will need a proxy network to bypass these network restriction imposed by schools and workplaces authorities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The second case is all about a very weird Steam’s pricing policy. Whenever you purchase a game from Steam, along with game you get keys to unlock the game.  You normally get two types of keys; the first one is the regional keys and the second one is the local key. The regional key is independent of any location, but the local key is not location independent, it is for the players of the given country only. Still wondering how come it is a problem and how will proxy act as a helping hand here? Let us go through a scenario, this scenario will definitely clear all of your doubts. For example, the local key for  Russian region for any game is much cheaper (because the target audience is much smaller when compared to the other countries) and at the same time, the same local key is comparatively costlier for other regions. It is really very strange, right? This restriction falls under a category which has everything to do with restrictions imposed by Steam, as they are the people restricting you. Using a proxy network you can bypass this geo-restriction by getting a proxy of the particular cheaper location you need.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The third case is about very weird Steam’s game distribution policies. Actually Steam has a different game list for different countries. In case you want to play a game that is not available in your country then you will not be able to do so. Again a very strange policy, right? This restriction falls under a category which has everything to do with restrictions imposed by Steam, as they are the people restricting you in this case. Using a proxy network you can bypass this content-based geo-restriction by getting an account and proxy of the particular location you want.</span>

### **How to use Steam on a proxy network &#8211; Step by step guide:**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So far we discussed Steam, proxy network and why do anyone will need a Proxy Network along with Steam when he or she can run Steam without a Proxy Network. Now let us get into the crux of our article i.e methods to use Steam on a proxy network:</span>

**1. By using Proxifier :-  <span style="font-weight: 400;"> You may use Proxifier, as Proxifier is the most advanced proxy client software which gives us an ability to run network applications behind a proxy server, who normally do not have any inbuilt option on their settings page where anyone can configure the proxy. It gives you an option to route different application through a different proxy. And also you can route rest of the traffic via the normal internet. You can also bypass firewall restrictions with the help of Proxifier. Sometimes it acts like VPN by encrypting the traffic channel. It also helps in resolving <a href="/blog/how-to-change-xbox-one-dns-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNS</a> names through a proxy server.</span>**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many wildcards options are available to easily allow or disallow application on Proxifier. Also provides you with a Dashboard to keep an eye on current network activities (connections, hosts, times, bandwidth usage, etc.) dynamically. It stores everything in form of log files.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Steps to configure Proxifier on your Windows PC:-</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">a. First, click on Proxy Servers in the Profile menu as shown in the screenshot.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2992" src="/assets/1-3.png" alt="steam on a proxy network" width="563" height="259" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">b. You will see a dialog box where you will get options to add, edit or remove proxy servers as shown in the screenshot.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2993" src="/assets/2-2.png" alt="steam on a proxy network" width="566" height="370" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Finally to add a proxy network you need to click on the Add button, which will take you to a window where you can feed the details of the proxy network as shown in the screenshot.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2994" src="/assets/3-2.png" alt="steam on a proxy network" width="490" height="584" />

**Address**<span style="font-weight: 400;">: In the address filed you need to fill the address of the proxy server, it can be a hostname or IPv4/IPv6 address.</span>

**Port**<span style="font-weight: 400;">: In the port filed you need to fill the port of the proxy server</span>

**Protocol**<span style="font-weight: 400;">: Choose a suitable protocol, below is the brief explanation of all of them:</span>

* <span style="font-weight: 400;">SOCKS version 4(A) — a widely used proxy server protocol that does not support authentication.    </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">          You can specify only User ID.</span>

* <span style="font-weight: 400;">SOCKS version 5 — has more features than version 4 and supports authentication. You can specify a username and password.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">          Technical documentation can be found at: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1928.txt and                          http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1929.txt </span>

* <span style="font-weight: 400;">HTTPS — HTTP proxy with SSL support for arbitrary ports.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">          Technical documentation can be found at: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2817.txt</span>

* <span style="font-weight: 400;">HTTP proxy with SSL tunnel support is also known as:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">          CONNECT proxy</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">          SSL proxy</span>

**_Here is the download_** [**_link_**](https://www.proxifier.com/download/)**_._**

**2. By using Proxycap :- <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Steam application is configured in a way to use UDP(User Datagram Protocol). You can use &#8220;-tcp launch&#8221; option while executing steam.exe to push the Steam application to route through TCP(Transmission control protocol) connections. This will allow you to run Steam application behind a proxy network.</span>**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, most of the Steam games use UDP protocol and cannot be pushed forward to use TCP channel under any circumstances.  In such cases, if you still want to play games using a proxy, you can use a proxy application that supports UDP, one of them is ProxyCap. ProxyCap has the ability to redirect UDP traffic via <a href="/blog/socks-5-advantages-using-socks-5-proxies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOCKS5</a> proxy. It can only happen when UDP relay is already activated or can be activated on the proxy server. Also, you need to make sure that connection through the proxy server is not lacking required speed. Here is the download </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">link</span>](http://www.proxycap.com/download.html)<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

**3. By using Proxychain :-  <span style="font-weight: 400;">You may run Steam with the help of proxychains following below steps on Linux:</span>**

* <span style="font-weight: 400;">Install </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Proxychain </span>](http://proxychains.sourceforge.net/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">on your linux box. </span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">Open terminal.</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">Edit file proxychains.conf available under /etc directory using the command “vim /etc/proxychains.conf” and entering proxy details like socks5    127.0.0.1 1080.</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">Execute “proxychains steam” on terminal..</span>

&nbsp;
