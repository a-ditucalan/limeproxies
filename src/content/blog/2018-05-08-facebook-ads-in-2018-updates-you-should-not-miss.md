<span style="font-weight: 400;">The year 2018 seems very promising for <a href="/blog/facebook-missed-call-ads-innovative-useless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> <a href="https://goo.gl/18cKS2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advertising</a> especially in the field of AI and ML. </span>

## **What&#8217;s new in Facebook Ads:**

* <span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook will conduct a series of tests based on the elements of Creative. Your final Ad will be the set according to the test.</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the availability of <a href="/blog/importance-small-data-big-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data</a>, Facebook will automatically switch the optimization objectives.</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">Other websites data will also be integrated with Facebook, and your Dynamic Products Ads will be displayed to an entirely new audience base. </span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it will be easier for you to allocate your ad budget between ad sets based on the performance</span>

You must be hearing about those location-based ads from different sources. While people seem to talk about it but hardly anyone used it. Goods news! Facebook is offering target-based ads with actual value. Now you can remarket to your users directly from your offline businesses.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you can use Dynamic Product Ads for travel and real estate too. New collections of Ad format has been developed for eCommerce stores, which is inspired by everyone’s “Favourite “print catalog. </span>

## **First, let’s learn some basics about a Facebook Ad Campaign:**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1525" src="/assets/First-let’s-learn-some-basics-about-a-Facebook-Ad-Campaign.png" alt="Facebook Ads in 2018" width="720" height="360" />

### **Objectives**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The type of ad you want to build is crucial while setting an objective. Also, Where your ad will be displayed is also something you must consider. However, according to power editor and ad managers, an objective is bit different. You need to modify your ad, length of your text, positioning, and size specification depending upon your objective. </span>

### **Creative**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to ad Creative, you need to focus on three major elements. Use these three elements in proper balance to create a perfect ad. </span>

#### **1. Ad copy**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The length of a sentence and the usage of words make a huge difference for a user to determine if they want to click it or swipe it. You should create captivating messages that will make you stand out from your competitors and other <a href="https://goo.gl/ifCcuc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> posts. Many in-house teams still use weak and ineffective Ad strategies even though they know the importance of a perfect ad copy. Refrain from using the elongated copy as you might chop it off and use it in ad placements.</span>

#### **2. Image**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For having a maximum impact, you must select and source the right image. For maximizing effect, you should incorporate copy within the limitation of Facebook and choose the optimal size according to your ad types. Otherwise, your image will be lower down to the size of a thumbnail.</span>

#### **3. Video**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Using video in an ad is in a growing phase now. Even though most companies don’t feel confident about it, but for the right product, you might need a video ad.</span>

### **Canvas**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Canvas is the new Ad used by Facebook to target mobile users. Most of the companies are using it. </span>

### **Targeting**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every month more than two billion people use Facebook. Facebook comes with a compelling audience selection <a href="/blog/9-marketing-tools-that-dont-cost-you-a-dime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tool</a>, which you can use to target the ideal user base based on their interests, behaviours, and demographics. </span>

### **Placement**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With using power editor or ad creation tool, you can select the place where you want your ads to appear on Facebook. </span>

### **Reporting**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To learn the performance of your ads and campaigns you need to get yourself familiar with the Facebook Ads Manager features. While it may take a while for newbies to understand but,it is not that hard. This feature helps you to view a regular report of your ad’s performance. With the regular report, you can make valid interpretation and formulate creative strategies to improve your ads</span>

### **Lead magnet development and integration with CRM**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with many Facebook advertisers, your goal must also be to capture the <a href="/blog/how-to-prevent-pixel-trackers-in-your-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">email</a> address of users. To help you with this, Facebook provides the Lead Generation ads. With </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">proper strategy, you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can both create and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expand your mailing list. To lure users to disclose their email address, you must create an irresistible lead magnet or freebie. However, getting a lead is not the primary objective. Follow-up is also quite crucial. How </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">effectively </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you decide to follow up plays a significant role in your Facebook campaign. </span>

### **Dynamic Creative**

#### **Split testing:**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a regular advertiser on Facebook, then you must </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">know</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ing</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that it is crucial to split test your ads and posts. With the split testing feature, you can analyze the quality of ads and figure out those ads that provide the best results. However, if you split test two different ads and they both turn out bad, it raises many questions. Are your ads not good enough? Are you targeting the wrong audience? Are you bidding low? The list go</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">es</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though you will learn a lot about ads through split testing, you won&#8217;t learn the overall <a href="/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-instagram-influencer-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketing</a> strategy. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook now offers Dynamic Creatives feature, that assists you in conducting proper testing of creative</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is impossible manually.  </span>

### **Advantages of Facebook Dynamic Ads:**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1526" src="/assets/Advantages-of-Facebook-Dynamic-Ads-1.png" alt="facebook dynamic ads" width="720" height="360" />

* #### ** Time friendly**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With this new feature, you will be able to save some of your precious time that you spend on creating the perfect ad. To save time, you have to prepare </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">product catalog</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ue</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">or product feed in advance. A product catalog</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ue</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">comprises the list of products that you want to advertise on Facebook . To generate an ad, you need to feed some basic information in each of your ads. The basic information must include the name, ID, description of the ad, etc. Now the above mentioned process used to consume a lot of time. However, with this Facebook PDA feature, all you have to do is create just one template. Next, Facebook will retrieve all the information related to your ad by going through your product catalog</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ue</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now no more busting your brain by doing the same work repeatedly. </span>

* #### **Remove out-of-stock Products**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a user gets excited to buy a product. When they  click on the product and find that the product is out of stock, it leads to disappointment. Disappointing a potential customer is bad for business. With this feature, you can avoid disappointing a customer. If you are a regular user of Facebook Ads, then you must have faced this issue. Sometimes, even though </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">after</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">all the products have been sold out, Facebook still displays the ad of your out-of-stock products. Now, thanks to the product catalog, you don’t have to waste your money and  space. The Facebook Dynamic Ad feature enables the product feed to inform Facebook that a product is out of stock. After receiving the information, Facebook automatically removes the ad. </span>

* #### **Reach more people**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook Dynamic Ads allows you to reach a large</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">r</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">user base. This feature will enable you to reach users no matter what devices they use. Now you can reach the user even if they use a smartphone. This feature was not available on Facebook Exchange. The new feature got a huge appreciation from all advertisers for its extensive reach. Now the dimension of marketing has changed. People are using mobile devices more to search a product compared to using a desktop. This feature will also give you relevant data regarding the sales generated through mobile devices. </span>

* #### **Create ads that are more relevant**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Facebook Dynamic Ad makes it possible for you to target a particular group of audience. Let&#8217;s say you want to focus on those customers who haven’t visited your website for a long time. Maybe you want to create a particular <a href="/blog/the-ultimate-adwords-retargeting-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ad targeting</a> only those customers. Good news, now its possible. Facebook comes with new features in Ads Manager and Power Editor, which displays the options such as “people who have not visited in a certain amount of time” and “people who visited a specific website and not others”. With such innovative </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">filters</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can segregate your audiences according to products, catalog them separately and target those audiences who are relevant to your ad. </span>

* #### **Target specific people**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dynamic retargeting feature of Facebook will amaze you even more than the audience option. Using this feature, you will be able to recognize those users who viewed your product from the catalog. To boost your sale, now you can target a specific user with ads. This feature will inform you whenever someone sees a product from a particular product ID from your catalog. It will also notify you if the product has been added to the cart or sold. For example, if a person visits your <a href="/blog/access-blocked-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> and looks at  specific number of products, then you can target the person with ads related to those products only. It will help you to find out the preference and likes of your audience, and you can focus on that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with similar products or products they might like even more. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some might think that the new Dynamic Product Ads on Facebook is similar to Google remarketing display ads, but they have dissimilarities of their own. Both <a href="/blog/how-to-use-google-as-proxy-server/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a> and Facebook help</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">you to reach a huge number of potential customers automatically. Google shows many products from a wide range of advertisers based on specific terms while Facebook displays ads to those users who visited your <a href="https://goo.gl/qq7M99" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> or app. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook has opened up many possibilities for the advertisers around the globe by introducing Dynamic Products Ads. It does not matter what kind of products or services you are involved with, you will most certainly be benefited with Dynamic Facebook Ad. Apart from being beneficial in many aspects, it is an efficient way to reveal your products and services to the right kind of audiences. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To take </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">complete</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">advantage of this new feature, you have to visit facebook.com/business. You will get step-by-step guidance on how to create a product catalog. This link also gives you a fair idea of how to use the feature to reap the maximum benefit. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting dynamic creative is easy. While setting up an ad, put the Dynamic Creative option to ON. Now submit up to 10 images and text variations </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">up to 5 for each ad</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then facebook will automatically find the best combination of those elements according to your objectives and run the final creative running ad. </span>

### **Optimizing your Conversion**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With this option, you can launch your ads with an objective to “Reach”. After you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gather</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ed</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">enough data, it will automatically switch to “Conversion” mode.</span>

#### **Why is conversion optimization necessary for some brands?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To be more efficient for your website and audience, facebook pixels require data. For startups, using conversions as the primary ad objective is challenging. The same applies to brands that set up the pixel for the first time. In such </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">scenario, it&#8217;s hard for a business to launch ads that haven’t seen many conversions and didn’t know what type of users it should target to convert. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, what you need to do is launching your ad keeping “Reach” as your objective. Then you have to wait for some purchases to happen. Then you have to relaunch the same ad with “Conversions” mode </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">advertisers, the above procedure takes a significant amount of time, and you won&#8217;t find enough time to do it manually. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now Facebook has come up with a solution. While launching your ad you can select both the objective. At first, Facebook will start by optimizing for “Reach.” After pixels gather enough data, it will optimize your objective to “Conversions”.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, your ads will be optimized efficiently, and you will enjoy a higher ROI.</span>

### **Optimizing your Campaign Budget**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you don’t have to check your ad sets manually. Also, you don’t have to allocate your budget between ad sets manually. The new campaign budget optimization feature of Facebook allows you to efficiently manage the budget between ad sets of your one ad campaign. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new feature, you can set up your daily or lifetime budget of your ad along with setting up bid caps and spending limits of your each ad set. </span>

#### **Reach to Multiple DPA reach with targeting Broad Audiences**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, on Facebook, you could target those users who used to browse your competitor’s websites and Facebook pages. You could focus on users who showed interest in your product or category. With features such as Interest filters/ lookalike audiences, you can now accumulate a massive base of new audiences who were unreachable as of now. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature is ideal for those advertisers who uploaded their product catalog on Facebook for Dynamic Product Ads (DPA). It is perfect for capturing a broad audience. It is best for startups who are going to compete with industrial giants or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">big names in the industry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Companies such as  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">E</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-commerce stores and <a href="https://goo.gl/j9x6qB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel</a> websites don’t have the opportunity to attract huge traffic to remarket their product and services. With Dynamic Product Ads, such companies can attract new cold audiences from the broad audiences to their site.</span>

### **Remarket to offline Users**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you can re-market your product and services to offline shoppers as well. Facebook gather precise location of users and allows you to remarket users who prefer buying offline. </span>

#### **For all offline conversion events, Facebook offers a wide range of remarketing options:**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now integrating your facebook API with your point of sale system, you can effectively target your offline buyers. It will be even better if you use offline CRM systems such as Marketo, Zapier, Leeds bridge, and Salesforce. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can target users who have shown interest in specific events through their Facebook event RSVPs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Target offline walk-in shoppers through business locations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While all CRM systems offer splendid results, they never allow advertisers to retarget offline leads. With the new location-based targeting feature of Facebook, you can merge offline and online marketing. </span>

### **Dynamic Product Ads expands to various sectors:**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now facebook provides ad templates customized for each type of products, which makes it easier for you to remarket users who visited your website by showing them relevant ads. Not just </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">E</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-commerce products, but you can now display ads relevant to real estate listings, flights, destinations, and hotels. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can either retarget your users by exposing them to the exact listing they visited or show listings similar to them. </span>

### **New ad format for e-commerce: Collection Ads**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The collection Ad features many lifestyle images and videos. It also comprises several products. The new collection ads are somewhat similar to old printing catalogs. Your users will have a good look at the products, and with the lifestyle imagery, they will also be exposed to a convincing use context.</span>

### **Low organic reach to be expanded all over the world**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As of November 2017, Facebook in some countries has decided not to show any news feed of any posts from pages. Now over the course of 2018, the rules will be expanded globally, and users won&#8217;t be able to see posts from pages, no matter if they follow the page or not. With such update, it became harder for advertisers to use SMM efficiently. Now to boost your SMM <a href="/blog/develop-content-resource-centre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content</a>, paid delivery of all your social content is the only option. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When a social post achieves a basic level of reach, you have to assess its performance based on its engagement, before giving it a boost. Now, doing it manually seems time-consuming. To your rescue, Facebook has launched the new auto-boosting feature. With this feature, you can expose your content to your followers with ease.</span>
