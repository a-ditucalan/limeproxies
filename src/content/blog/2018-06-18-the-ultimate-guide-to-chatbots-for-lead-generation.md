<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">You can make use of free platforms mentioned above. These platforms doesn’t require you to know how to write a code.</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Write down your desired script for a chatbot. This is what the bot says during an engagement with a user.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Information provided by the user is directed to the landing pages.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In creating or building a chatbot, the following are used;</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Build: This is done according to your planned script</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">SetUp AI: This has to do with sets of script instructions</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Broadcast: It involves sending/broadcast messages to all users that engages with bot</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a blank chatbot button you can connect with your landing page. Two built in blocks like welcome message and default message is used.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a block to extract the user’s phone number by putting a conversation forward. Start a text to let the user know what you need from her. Add a plugin that asks for the phone number and later save the phone number to a new variable called phone. After this you can add this contact to your Google sheets. To save your time, you can duplicate the entire block.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You will need to send data to zapier with webhook. You can now move it to Google sheets. JSON API is developed and designed to send your data to zapier. JSON API is a plugin.</span>

### **3. Zapier**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By then, you have set a lead for your website.</span>

#### **Other ways to generate leads using chatbot**

**1. Facebook Ads**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since facebook has the highest number of social media users. You can drive your clients/customers from facebook ad to messenger. Your messenger will be integrated with chatbot. So there is instant reply for any question being asked on your messenger. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your bot will engage with them to generate leads. Whenever a user clicks on your facebook ad, they will be directed to your business page. Customers finds filling of forms stressful or cumbersome, and those who supplied their email address don’t usually check their email box.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So the conversion rate is low compared to when a bot interacts with a user. People tend to respond more quickly on messenger, which gives the lead generated a higher success rate.</span>

**2. Facebook messenger Pop up**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People may be driven to your facebook page when searching for a related business of yours. So when people visit or lands on your facebook page, a pop up window will appear. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your chatbot will interact with them and use information collected for generating leads</span>

**3. Adequate response to customer feedbacks**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us assume someone commented on your page, the chatbot may interact to thank them for the comments and tell them them if there is any help that can be further rendered to them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An article on your facebook page may prompt a user to comment. The bot may continue to engage till the personal data of such individual is collected. And this can generate leads</span>

**4. Constant content sharing**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your chatbot may be designed to give daily content about your product to all your customers/clients. Even a link to other post of yours may be shared. Through this information can be gotten and this is a potential lead.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, marketing will be made easier with the full engagement of chatbots. Also customer service will be par excellence with the full integration of chatbots on our websites.</span>

 <span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be higher number of leads generated by using the bots. As years goes by, full integration of Artificial intelligence will be seen chatbots and this will make customer experience better thereby leading to higher number of leads</span>
