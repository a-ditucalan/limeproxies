<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is that a lot of websites are blocked, some based on <a href="https://bit.ly/2Lkz1yW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">geographical location</a>, and some based on content. This leads us to the important question of how to open blocked websites. This article will discuss how one can access websites that are <a href="/blog/access-blocked-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blocked</a> by using proxies. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that there are a number of ways to open blocked websites. Advocates of internet freedom have developed and are continually developing ways to bypass restrictions in an effort to maintain freedom in the world of internet.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The controversy over </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Net Neutrality</span>](https://www.limevpn.com/net-neutrality/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">has become like a stone inside the shoes of internet users all over the world. For some, the repeal of Net Neutrality by most governments has become annoying and irritating and somewhat unfair.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People open a website expecting to have the freedom to see and access everything they need, only to find out that some web pages or even the whole website are blocked in the country where they are located. It does not matter that the website is for entertainment, business, or personal transactions. The fact is that the <a href="/blog/internet-things-technology-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet</a> should be a free world. All data must be treated equally, regardless of source, destination, size, and content. This is the basic principle of Net Neutrality which has been slowly disintegrating due to government regulations that do not support it.</span>

### **How to Open Blocked Websites by Proxy?**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2017" src="/assets/Unlock-01.png" alt="OPEN BLOCKED WEBSITES BY PROXY" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned, one of the methods that will enable anyone to access blocked websites is by using proxies. This article is focused on explaining how proxies work and how they can help open websites that are otherwise blocked.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A <a href="/blog/reasons-why-your-company-should-use-proxy-servers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proxy server</a> acts as a middleman between the user and the destination website. The user connects to the proxy server and asks it to connect to the server of the website the user wants to access. The proxy server then makes the connection to the other server on behalf of the user.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And since it was the proxy server who made the request, the website won’t know that it was actually the user who is accessing it. It is like hiding behind the proxy server. This way, the website has no way of knowing which country the user is from, thereby allowing them to bypass geographical and even government restrictions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By using proxies, the user’s IP address is masked and hidden. A different IP address will be used by the proxy server and this depends on the proxy selected.</span>

### **Other Ways to Open Blocked Websites**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2019" src="/assets/Unlock-03.png" alt="OTHER WAYS TO OPEN BLOCKED WEBSITES " width="720" height="361" />

#### <span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Type in the IP address instead of the URL</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The URL of each website is associated with an IP address. There are times when the people blocking a certain website only by the URL and not the IP address. In this case, do a ping command, to get the IP address of the particular website.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to Start > Run, then type </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">cmd</span>_ <span style="font-weight: 400;">and press enter. Enter the command: </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">ping url.com.</span>_

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Type in the <a href="/blog/rotate-ip-address/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP address</a> into the address bar, and the website can be accessed. This method is effective if the authorities who blocked the website did not include the IP address. If they did, then another method must be used.</span>

#### <span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Modify the DNS Server</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The DNS settings on any device can be modified to use Google DNS or OpenDNS instead. CloudFlare also has its own DNS services. Just make sure to save the original DNS settings before making any changes so that there will be something to revert to in case connectivity problems are encountered.</span>

#### <span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Tor browser</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tor is an IP Anonymizer that becomes more effective when used together with proxies. Users will be able to access blocked websites and at the same time, they will be hidden from prying eyes. The only drawback is a low speed.</span>

### **The Bottom Line**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is disheartening that the banning and restrictions of websites because of geographical restrictions and government regulations has become a reality these days. The bright side to all these, however is that there are still ways (a number of them, actually) to open blocked websites.</span>

 <span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the methods that are effective and popular in unblocking websites is by using proxies. Proxies work by acting as a middleman and hiding the real identity of the user. The website that the users want to access will not know who the user is or where they are located, allowing them to access it freely as they would in the ideal world.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are free public proxies available, but users would need to share an IP address with a lot of people. There are downsides to this because the other users of the same IP address might be doing things that can get the IP address banned. If this happens, the user’s access can suffer too. Using free public proxies will also affect the <a href="http://www.limevpn.com/how-to-improve-the-speed-of-your-vpn-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">speed of the connection</a> because a lot of people are sharing the bandwidth. There are even moments when the connection slows down to a crawl because of the high number of people using the same public proxy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People, however, can buy decent proxies at $4.99 per month, and the rate goes down on purchasing proxies in bulk. A minimum amount of money will be shelled out, but there is a guarantee of decent if not exemplary speed, exclusive use of IP address, and more.</span>
