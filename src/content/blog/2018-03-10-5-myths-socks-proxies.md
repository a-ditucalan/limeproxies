<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of us have heard about <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="https://limeproxies.com/blog/proxy-can-can-help/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proxy</a> recently because this technology is in the limelight due to the ongoing war between internet users and government, ISPs and even tech giants like Google and Apple.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I say war because it literally is, we are trying to <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="https://limeproxies.com/blog/privacy-predictions-for-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protect our privacy</a>, have freedom and equality on the internet. You can even call this as a modern form of the freedom struggle.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Proxies were not always associated with privacy or <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="https://limeproxies.com/blog/internet-things-technology-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet security</a>. In simple terms, they were just used as a layer between the local area network (LAN) and the internet adding some structure to such systems.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you wish to request some data, your request will first go to the proxy server, the server then forwards it to the internet and in the same way, brings back the results. So this made proxy an excellent tool to be used for anonymity and thus evolved today’s web proxy services that we know of.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With time, proxies evolved and today we have <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="https://limeproxies.com/blog/socks-5-advantages-using-socks-5-proxies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOCKS5</a>, Reverse, Residential type of proxies to name a few. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You might have heard about SOCKS proxies but this is not something most of us know of, so we come up with speculations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I checked many proxy forums and gathered few myths that people usually have and as most of the proxy providers sell SOCKS proxies, I am going to burst these myths so that you can better understand what SOCKS actually is.</span>

&nbsp;

<h3 dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-right: -32.25pt;">
  <b>1. Encryption:</b>
</h3>

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone wp-image-984 size-large" src="/assets/The-Travelogue-3.png" alt="encryption" width="700" height="525" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike protocols like OpenVPN and L2TP, SOCKS doesn’t <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="https://limeproxies.com/blog/need-know-encryption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">encrypt the data</a> being transferred. OpenVPN and L2TP are tunnelling protocols which are used for VPN, while SOCKS acts as a gateway for communication for devices behind the firewall.  It doesn’t try to understand or modify the traffic between the client and the server.</span>

&nbsp;

### **2. SOCKS is slow:**

<img class="alignnone wp-image-992 size-large" src="/assets/The-Travelogue-6.png" alt="socks is slow" width="700" height="525" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important that we ask this question, what platform is it operating? Does it really affect the end to end data transfer?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we discussed earlier, SOCKS doesn’t encrypt nor does it interfere or interpret the traffic which surely makes it faster compared to other protocols. The major factor when it comes to internet speed is your original bandwidth, SOCKS doesn’t really contribute to slowing things down.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You might also have seen VPN providers introducing<a style="color: #f04b23;" href="https://limeproxies.com/socks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> SOCKS5 protocol for downloading Torrents</a>. This is because it will give their users better downloading speed and with SOCKS version 5, they can add authentication.</span>

&nbsp;

### **3. Authentication and support for UDP:**

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1003" src="https://limeproxies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/The-Travelogue-8-1-700x525.png" alt=" Authentication and support for UDP" width="100%" height="" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is true that earlier version of SOCKS didn’t support authentication or UDP (User Datagram Protocol) but things changed with the introduction of SOCKS5 protocol.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">SOCKS5 was specifically designed to accommodate UDP, streaming applications and of course it included authentication. So with authentication only authorized users can access the server.</span>

&nbsp;

### **4. Deploying SOCKS is difficult:**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-979" src="https://limeproxies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/The-Travelogue-700x525.png" alt="Deploying SOCKS is difficult" width="100%" height="" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although as <a style="color: #f04b23;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">end users</a> this is something that you really do not need to worry. But I have seen this being said frequently on forums. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, before the introduction of SOCKS5 this was true, it required programming skills to configure SOCKS. But with the new version 5, configuration has really become easy by using a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) in case of Windows and shared libraries in case of Linux. So even we, as an end user can configure SOCKS.</span>

&nbsp;

### **5. SOCKS is not useful compared to other security protocols available:**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-989" src="https://limeproxies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/The-Travelogue-5-700x525.png" alt="SOCKS is not useful" width="100%" height="" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is in context to SOCKS proxies. As we discussed earlier SOCKS5 now supports UDP as well as streaming application and it is largely used in online gaming. So, if you are looking for using <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="https://limeproxies.com/gaming.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proxies in online gaming</a> you  first need an application that will act as a bridge between the proxy and gaming server. Most of these applications only support SOCKS, so the normal web proxy will not work. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also used for downloading Torrent instead of VPN due to its faster speed while keeping you anonymous.</span>

&nbsp;

### **Conclusion:**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, proxies have a wide range of usage from web scraping to helping you stay anonymous online and SOCKS is like cherry on the top. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from its simplicity, SOCKS5 also provides security and speed which normal proxies lack.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hope now you get a gist of what exactly SOCKS is and what it is not. So next time you are about to purchase proxies, do check for SOCKS option. </span>
