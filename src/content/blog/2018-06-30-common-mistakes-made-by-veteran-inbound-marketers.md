<span style="font-weight: 400;">Only businesses that go with the flow of modern times grow. And these days, this means taking advantage of the <a href="/blog/how-to-speed-up-your-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet</a> and the modern technology in order to attract more customers and drive sales.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most effective lead <a href="/blog/how-marketing-teams-can-keep-pace-with-customer-intelligence-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketing</a> strategies of today is inbound marketing, which is a strategy for attracting customers using blogs, content marketing, social media marketing, <a href="/blog/how-to-use-b2b-seo-to-generate-high-quality-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search engine optimization</a>, and other forms of pull marketing. It sounds a bit complex, and well, it actually is.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to become an effective inbound <a href="/blog/digital-marketers-using-windows-10-increase-efficiency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketer</a>, you have to know how to make all these pull marketing techniques work together. You have to find the balance. The thing about inbound marketing is that it is constantly evolving and changing. Even veteran inbound marketers are sometimes at a loss when it comes to their strategies which seemed to be working before, but now the results of their efforts are plateauing and even declining.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is especially true for companies whose startup marketing strategy is inbound three to six years. They were one of the few players in the field, and they enjoyed results after results, growth after growth. Here come other companies who want a share of the pie, and the strategies of these veteran inbound marketers stop working.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is this? What could have happened? Surely there is a place for everyone in the business side of the internet, right?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This article does not aim to answer all those questions, but it gives you the five most common mistakes made by veteran inbound marketers. Yes, even veterans – the ones who had been doing this for years – can make and are making these mistakes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a veteran inbound marketer, these five things may ring a bell. If you are new in this area, then read on so you will know what things to do or not to do in the world of inbound marketing.</span>

### **1. Buyer Profile or Persona**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1942" src="/assets/Marketing-Mistake-02.png" alt="BUYER PROFILE OR PERSONA Inbound Marketers" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A buyer persona is a fictional character who represents your ideal or target <a href="/blog/a-guide-on-customer-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customer</a>. Of course, the attributes and characteristics of a company’s buyer persona are greatly based on real data and market research.                          </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most veterans in inbound marketing don’t have a written, precise, and clear buyer persona. And herein lies a major problem because buyer personas are very important as they provide companies a clear and straight insight. It helps them define limits, priorities and even helps in product development.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a buyer persona, you will know what content to create, what keywords to focus on, what type of posts to boost, what images attract potential customers, and many more. Above all, if you have buyer profiles, these can act as triggers for specific actions such as <a href="/blog/how-to-prevent-pixel-trackers-in-your-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">email </a>responses.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, buyer personas can align all processes within the company and without it, companies are left with a lot of things to do but with no clear <a href="/blog/am-i-a-target-for-online-price-discrimination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">target</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating personas is not a walk in the park, but it is doable, and in fact, it must be done. You really have to sit down and create a thorough client profile and you should be able to determine the following items among others:</span>

* <span style="font-weight: 400;">       The challenges that the persona is facing;</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">       His or her priorities;</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">       Concrete identifiers such as gender, age, nationality, etc.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is one buyer persona or profile enough? This really depends on how many different types of people you are trying to attract. Some businesses have only 1 to 5 buyer profiles, while others have as much as 15 to 20. The key is to really know your product and services and to whom they are for.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The tricky part about creating buyer profiles is that the task is a never-ending one. You are never done with buyer personas or profiles. People are constantly changing. Their needs and wants today may not be the same in the next couple of weeks, months, or years. Thus, your buyer persona should constantly be checked and revised and updated.</span>

### **2. Content Map**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1943" src="/assets/Marketing-Mistake-03.png" alt="content map" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A content map is simply a list of all site pages, landing pages, blogs, CTAs, and graphics with the corresponding answers to the following questions:</span>

* <span style="font-weight: 400;">       Which buyer profile is this site page, blog post, etc., targeted to?</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">       Which buying stage is this built for?</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">       What does this intend to achieve?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Content mapping ensures that everything in your <a href="https://goo.gl/kGTxBB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> is useful and accounted for. Above all, it ensures that your website visitors are catered well and that you have answered their questions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge of most veteran inbound marketers who seem to have lost touch is either they don’t have a content map or their content map is outdated. They have failed to see the significance of having a content map.</span>

### **3. Website**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1944" src="/assets/Marketing-Mistake-04.png" alt="websites" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Veteran inbound marketers do not see the real value of their company’s website. Websites are seen as something static, somewhere to dump all information about a company and its products and services. Just add these here, and done. The next time the company has a new product, add that one here and done.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, all these thoughtless additions to the website pile up until you are left with a puzzling and overloaded <a href="/blog/access-blocked-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>. Let us make one thing clear though: updating and making changes to your website is a must, but you have to do it in a mindful and planned way.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember these top ten characteristics of a website that are important and essential:</span>

* <span style="font-weight: 400;">       Accessible and friendly to all users including the elderly and disabled;</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">       Compatible wth mobile <a href="/blog/how-to-maintain-phone-privacy-get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">phones </a>and tablets;</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">       Well planned structure of information that makes it easy for users to find a certain information;</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">       Fast load times;</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">       Content that is well-formatted and easy to read;</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">       Error messages are displayed correctly;</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">       Contrasting color scheme;</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">       Usable and sensible forms</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">       Easy navigation;</span>
* <span style="font-weight: 400;">       Compatible with different browsers.</span>

&nbsp;

### **4. Nurturing Strategy**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1945" src="/assets/Marketing-Mistake-05.png" alt="nurturing strategies" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So you have generated leads through inbound marketing, and that is great! Well, it is for a few months, until you see that there is no conversion of leads to sales. What are you doing wrong?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Veteran inbound marketers find out that <a href="/blog/how-to-use-b2b-seo-to-generate-high-quality-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">generating leads</a> and then bombarding these leads with sales pitches do not work at all. You have to add value to them. You have to be able to help them. You have to answer the questions that are in their minds. Then and only then can they make the important decision to buy your products and services.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you do this? Great content is the key. This attracts people and gives useful information. Nurturing also requires a personalized touch. Emails must be sent in such a way that the recipient will think that the company is really thinking about them.</span>

### **5. Data Collection and Utilization**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1946" src="/assets/Marketing-Mistake-06.png" alt="data collection and utilization" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Inbound marketing enables you to gather a lot of data from your target customers. Which web pages are getting a lot of traffic? Is the traffic being converted into <a href="/blog/how-social-media-marketing-generated-7-million-in-affiliate-sales-for-this-entrepreneur/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sales</a>? Which posts are getting the most engagement? Do these posts generate sales? These data are then analyzed into deeper and probing questions. Why aren’t all the traffic and engagement converted into sales? Why are people buying? Why are people not buying?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Inbound marketing becomes effective when the data being collected are utilized and analyzed. And it does not stop there. After analyzing the data, you have to make the necessary changes.</span>

### **In Conclusion**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Inbound marketers, regardless whether they are veteran or not, are faced with the same challenges. The market is constantly changing, the technology is always upgrading, and new marketing methods are being introduced.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The key is to just go with the flow and make changes along the way. Do not stop changing your buyer profile or your website or even your products just because you think you have enough customers and you are satisfied with the status of your company. Pretty soon, some of your existing customers will change their minds and lifestyles, and you will be left behind.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These five common mistakes that veteran inbound marketers make are all too common. By reading this article, however, you will hopefully avoid committing these mistakes in your company.</span>
