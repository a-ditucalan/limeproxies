<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="/blog/10-instagram-marketing-tips-for-brands-and-social-media-managers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marketing</a> remains to be a fundamental and critical aspect of any business entity. As the world becomes more and more modernized and reliant on technology, marketing has also evolved.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, any business organization that wants to succeed needs to employ strategic digital marketing. And take note that when you say strategic digital marketing, you are not only talking about a simple, one-fits-all approach.  Success in digital marketing requires businesses to take into account different features and aspects, depending on the business organization’s overall marketing strategy, goals, and even budget.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the numerous features, aspects, and tasks involved in implement a full-blown marketing strategy that is sure to be successful, people running a business easily get lost. This is why <a href="/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-marketing-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketing automation</a>, a side effect of the modernization and evolution of marketing, is a very welcome innovation.</span>

## **Marketing Automation Features**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we delve deeper into the comparison of different marketing automation solutions provider, let us first find out the main features of marketing automation. These features enable businesses to perform marketing tasks such as identifying potential customers, turning marketing leads into sales, and the likes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So below are the basic features, and while browsing through the following list, identify which features can help your business successfully.</span>

### **Lead generation and tracking**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1893" src="/assets/Lead-generation-and-tracking.png" alt="LEAD GENERATION AND TRACKING with Marketing Automation Stack" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead generation is the process in a marketing strategy of capturing the interest of target customers in a business’ products and services. Capturing their interest is not enough though. You would need to track your leads by gathering their <a href="/blog/how-to-prevent-pixel-trackers-in-your-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">email addresses</a>, sending out emails, and the likes.</span>

### **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The aim of CRM is to cultivate a relationship with your existing <a href="/blog/a-guide-on-customer-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customers</a> and even potential customers.  Customer data and communication are analyzed which will help in customer retention and in effect drive up sales.</span>

### **Contact forms**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1894" src="/assets/Contact-forms.png" alt="CONTACT FORMS" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You place contact forms in your websites so that your customers and potential customers have a venue to contact you conveniently. Allowing them to contact you is great, but what happens when you are unable to respond to their queries within the reasonable time? This is where automated contact forms come in handy. When a customer fills out the contact form, they will get an automated response which you can actually customize and personalize. </span>

### **Landing pages**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies have shown that the more landing pages a business has, the more marketing <a href="/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-chatbots-for-lead-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leads</a> it generates. A website that has 8 to 10 landing pages can generate 50% more leads compared to a website that only has 5 landing pages or below. This is why automating landing page creation is very ideal. Simple web pages can be cloned so that customized landing pages can be automatically launched when a specific keyword or campaign is used.</span>

### **Email campaigns**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1895" src="/assets/Email-campaigns.png" alt="EMAIL CAMPAIGNS" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing remains to be the most effective type of marketing for any business. Aside from the basic newsletters, and sales pitch emails, more and more business automate their emails in such a way that emails are triggered by the customer’s actions. These are more effective as they are highly personalized and they are sent out in response to a customer’s needs and interest.</span>

### **Segmentation**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatically filtering your contacts list based on pre-set data is a very helpful process in the overall marketing strategy. It helps you save time since you don’t have to manually segregate the contact information of your audience, depending on their behavior and the data collected.</span>

### **Content marketing**

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1896" src="/assets/Content-marketing-1.png" alt="CONTENT MARKETING" width="720" height="360" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A wide array of informative and interesting content is not enough to make your business a success. You need to market your content and let the people know about your blog posts and articles. However, this may take so much time and energy. With automation, however, you will be able to market your content easily and more effectively.</span>

### **Dynamic content**

This automation allows you to customize the content presented to an audience, depending on the behavior of such audience.</span>

## **Two Marketing Automation Approaches**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Needless to say, the manual execution of the features discussed above are very time-consuming. They also take so much effort from your part, thus taking you away from other activities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales and marketing automation tools will definitely enable you to implement your strategy with no hassle, plus it will give you more time for other equally important tasks. You can choose between two marketing automation approaches: a full-stack automation system or a custom-stack automation approach.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Full-stack Automation Approach</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A full-stack automation approach refers to a complete, all-in-one system which includes all or numerous features of digital marketing. We will discuss these features in detail later in this article. Examples of a full-stack automation system are Marketo and Hubspot.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom-stack Automation Approach</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The custom-stack approach enables you to choose different solutions provider for executing different features. You may or may not opt to implement all features, depending on your business organization’s marketing strategy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The sales and marketing automation approach that is right for you and your business depends on several things including your technical expertise and of course, your budget. If you have a high level of technical know-how, you may be able to perform some automation tasks on your own so you don’t need a full-stack automation. In the process, you will save some money.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, if you don’t have enough technical expertise, then a custom-stack automation is not suitable for you. You would need to choose an all-in-one system to take care of your marketing automation needs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This article aims to help you choose between the two automation approaches by comparing the features and prices of some popular marketing automation solutions providers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With full-stack automation, you need to shell out $1,000 or more every month, not including the one-time set up fee that comes with each solutions provider. But you can also get the same automation features at less than $300 a month if you use the custom-stack approach.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The automation provider is different from one feature to another, and as previously said, you may find this approach challenging especially if you don’t have enough technical expertise. In this scenario, you may find the full-stack automation approach more sensible and appropriate for your business since you will be dealing with just one provider.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But for those companies who are still starting out, you may find the custom-stack approach more flexible as you get to choose which features to focus on. You will also be able to take advantage of free resources that are readily available.</span>

### **The Bottom Line**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter which stage your business is in right now, you definitely need to implement a marketing strategy that is at par with the current trend in the industry. Taking advantage of automation tools will help you drive up more leads and generate sales, and marketing automation is no exception.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can choose between full-stack automation or custom-stack automation approach, depending on your budget and technical know-how. You just need to identify first which features are crucial for your business success. If you decide that you don’t need to implement all marketing features, then the custom-stack approach may be the most cost-effective choice for you. You will only spend less than $300 per month, a huge savings from going for the all-in-one system which will cost you no less than $1,000 every month.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you want to take advantage of all tools and features that marketing automation has to offer, you might feel more inclined to select the full-stack approach and stick with just one solutions provider. Whatever approach you choose, make sure that it is the best for your business.</span>
