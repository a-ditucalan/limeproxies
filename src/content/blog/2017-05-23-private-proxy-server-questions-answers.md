So if you are in Manhattan but you advertise in Belgium, Europe you have the same experience using the internet as if you were in Belgium, too. When you connect to the internet by proxy you can use it like other users in Japan, UK, and Russia. This is extremely useful and effective for QA and for testing purposes as well – because you can make sure that all Geo-targeting is functioning well shown adequately.
