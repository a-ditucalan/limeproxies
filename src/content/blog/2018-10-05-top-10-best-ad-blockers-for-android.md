[Ads](http://limeproxies.com/blog/linkedin-introduced-carousel-ads-in-the-b2b-platform/)!! Do you hate them? Well, we hate them too.

Something that most of us hate, something that drastically affects our web browsing experience. There was a time when ads were limited to desktops and laptops only. But Android, being a Google product inherits all those irritating ads pop-ups to smartphones.

Before we dig in deeper you must be thinking why there are a lot of ads everywhere when most of us are annoyed with them. The answer to this question is here: Android App developers make money through advertising. Surprisingly most of the times the apps show relevant advertisements. Finding it hard to believe? Just look for a product on  Amazon or any e-commerce site, you will then start seeing related ads everywhere.

Good websites keep limited ads to make the customer experience better. But, again there are websites which are filled with ads and are not even well customized for smartphones.

### Problems related to ads

1. It&#8217;s annoying.
2. It drains out the battery.
3. Increases web page/application loading time.
4. Increase in bandwidth consumption.
5. It can be malicious, may steal your private as well as critical data if clicked.
6. Ads are highly annoying while playing games.

The most effective solution to get rid of these ads is to use ad-blocker apps. There are a plenty of ad-blocker apps available on Google Play store as well as on independent websites. But not every app works for your purpose or are good enough to use.  Many a time they turn out to be data stealers or disguised malware.

Most of the ad blocker applications are not available on the Google Play Store. Strange, right?  You must be thinking that being an android application why isn&#8217;t ad blockers applications available in Google Play Store? Actually, Google has a  strange policy towards ad blockers apps, according to which any app that can block ads across the device is not allowed. Google has only less effective Ads blockers apps (which are hardly useful) available in its store. No need to worry as you can get them from their respective websites or from many other application stores. For your ease, I have mentioned their download links.

Before we go into the crux of the matter one thing you need to know is that some good apps/websites need little ads to survive. In such cases, you can opt for the type of  Ad blockers which have an option to whitelist websites or applications, so that you may surf your favorites happily.

Fortunately, you are at the right place. After a lot of research, we have prepared a list of top 10 best Ad blockers for andriod apps which will surely serve your purpose.
