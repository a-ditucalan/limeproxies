  not all of them are born as coders or developers. With high proficient coders
  using tools that we merely understand, there are tools which can help you
  analyse information even if you are not technically sound. In this article, we

Everyone in this world is born with a special talent, but you should know that not all of them are born as coders or <a href="/blog/how-developers-use-premium-proxies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developers</a>. With high proficient coders using tools that we merely understand, there are tools which can help you analyse information even if you are not technically sound. In this article, we will discuss few non-technical tools that we use in day to day life that is prominently used in the world of <a href="/blog/difference-between-big-data-vs-data-science-vs-data-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data analytics</a>.

Before we jump into that, let’s see how <a href="/blog/what-is-data-analysis-in-research-and-how-to-do-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data analysis</a> is done, It is a long but an effective procedure of extracting useful data from a data dump. This procedure includes a lot of qualitative and quantitative methods to extract the required data, of course, this is not done manually, there are a lot of tools that are used to process these data and get a clean output.

Let&#8217;s have a look at some of these tools.

### 1. MS Excel

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2625" src="/assets/15-Data-Analysis-Tool-01.png" alt="data analysis tools - excel" width="720" height="361" />

With a increasing popularity of tools in the market, [Excel](https://products.office.com/en-in/excel) has emerged as the most used or most effective tools in data analysis industry, this tool has its part in every problem solved in analytics industry. With over thousands of formulae, it is always believed that if you have mastered MS Excel, nothing is tough for you.

With the ability to extract data, filter and summarise them, Excel has every capability of inspecting data from all the possible ways. Even though Excel is paid, it is highly recommended to have it on your list of applications. For those who do not want to pay and still want to reap benefits, there are various other tools like Spreadsheets, Google Docs which are available for free. But you should note that not all the features are available with these free tools.

The web-based GUI is compatible with only 4 of the most used browser i.e Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE.

H2O is even capable of building advanced machine learning tools in a quick span of time with no effort, H2O uses iterative methods to answer queries for clients data, when there are no perfect computations being done, it also settles down with approximate results. H2o basically divides the complete data into parts and then analyses them using the same technique. These results are then combined to get accurate results using a different algorithm.

H2O runs on the following versions for programming languages

1. Java (6 and above),
2. Python (2.7.x, 3.5.x),
3. R (3.0.0 and above)
4. Scala (1.4-1.6).

**Conclusion**
