<span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing the popularity of Facebook I didn’t think that there would be any social media platform that could sustain the competition from Facebook. Of course, I was proved wrong by Instagram, a name that we all have surely heard of.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="/blog/facebook-missed-call-ads-innovative-useless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> saw a huge market with Instagram and bought it in 2012 for  $1,000,000,000</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of statics, Instagram has over 800 million users all over the globe and a whopping 500 million active users share more than 250 million contents every day. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a survey, while Facebook’s user engagement is less than 0.1%, Instagram has a  regular engagement of 4% of the total follower (source: Forrester) and over 60% of users follow a brand on Instagram (source: Iconosquare)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So what makes Instagram stand out? What I believe is that people prefer pictures over text and  Instagram is all about that. This makes it easy for brands to target their audience with new arrivals, promotions, etc.</span>

### **<a style="color: #f04b23;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marketing</a> with Proxies For  Instagram:**

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1105" src="/assets/instagram-3157976_960_720.jpg" alt="instagram advertising with proxies" width="" height="" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you have a platform to promote your brand but how can you make a difference or stand out in a crowd of 800 million? The answer lies in what I believe are the most important rules when you start a business account on Instagram.</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <strong>You should know what you are doing and have a clear vision</strong>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <strong>You should post frequently, there shouldn’t be more than 2 days of gap between each post and use the Instagram story option every day to engage your followers</strong>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <strong>You should know the type of followers you have and your post should reflect what they want to see</strong>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you keep these rules in mind, you are off to a good start. I would also like to share few pointers that I have gathered from various blogs which I implement on my own Instagram business account and trust me it helps</span>

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Keeping myself informed about my followers</span>\*\***:  \*\*<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best features Instagram has to offer is “Demographics”. This gives you a wide range of information like the average age of your followers, their country, gender, days of the week when your followers are most active to name a few</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Having an appropriate profile</span></strong>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  This is very important because when someone checks your Instagram account, your profile picture and the bio is noticed first.</span>

* **Profile Picture: <span style="font-weight: 400;">It only makes sense to use your logo as the profile picture for your account. If you do not have one, I would recommend building one because this will be the face of your <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="https://www.dnfinder.in/blog/best-seo-practices-that-will-help-your-website-rankings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business</a>. </span> **

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using Instagram Stories</span></strong>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Back in 2016, Instagram started “Stories” where you can post a video or picture which will be automatically removed after 24 hours.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1109" src="/assets/Untitled-design-9.png" alt="instagram advertising with lime proxies" width="700" height="525" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This tool is very useful to engage with your followers. For example, I have an account related to food, so I post my cooking videos and recipes or conduct regular polls.</span>

### **Why use Proxies?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we know how important Instagram is when it comes to marketing and some of the key points to keep in mind while using Instagram for marketing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So why would there be need of using proxies for Instagram? Below are the three main reasons that lead to the use of proxies:</span>

* **You want to use multiple accounts to <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="/blog/ultimate-startup-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promote your brand</a> so that it reaches maximum people.**
* **You are a marketer handling multiple Instagram accounts** 
* **You want to use Instagram automation tools with which you can automate likes, sending follow requests and commenting using your Instagram account.**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you try to use multiple accounts or automation tools from one internet connection or IP address, Instagram <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="/blog/access-blocked-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blocks</a> them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only way to avoid this is by using proxies which will provide you with multiple <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="/blog/how-to-hide-my-public-ip-address/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP addresses</a>. You can associate one IP to one-to-two Instagram accounts but keep in mind to get <a style="color: #f04b23;" href="http://limeproxies.com/dedicated.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Premium or dedicated proxies</a> for this use.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a style="color: #f04b23;" href="http://www.rackseo.com/lime/pricing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Premium proxies</a> will be fresh i.e., not used before </span>

### **Conclusion:**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram is one of the most powerful platform available today for marketing which is a visual treat for users. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When used wisely you can build an empire that will help you expand your business and increase your revenue by a great number. </span>
