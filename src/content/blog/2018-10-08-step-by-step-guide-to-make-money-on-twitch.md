<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2655" src="/assets/Twitch-Money-01.jpg" alt="make money with twitch - 01" width="720" height="361" />

First and foremost, you must open a twitch account with your login details. Now, don’t hesitate while signing up for premium version. You can get some of the extra benefits like, sponsors, paid fans chat etc., if you go for premium subscription. (Note: If you have been broadcasting live gaming videos on YouTube, then no need to panic on how to transfer all your recorded videos to Twitch, without copyrights issue. Due to some internal agreement, you can transfer your account to Twitch, without any hassle. Only those things will be allowed that are permitted as per Twitch agreement policy) Now, to shift your YouTube account to Twitch, you must meet the following criteria:

  1. More than 15,000 views on your gaming broadcasted videos.
  2. You must have more than 100,000 subscribers.
  3. Your content must comply with the Twitch terms of service and DMCA(Digital Millennium Copyright Act)

### Step-2: Choose a proper game

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2656" src="/assets/Twitch-Money-02.jpg" alt="make money with twitch 02" width="720" height="361" />

Now, there are already many gamers in Twitch that have their own fan base and sponsors that pay them, to try their newly launched game and promote it for purchase. In such situation, it will be difficult for you gather large number of subscribers in less time. To counter this, it’s better you go for those games that are less popular and are in less demand. This step might seem slow but to stay in Twitch for long run, you have to start from scratch. These small games will bring you decent amount of subscribers and then, subsequently, your subscriber’s numbers will start to increase.(Note- If you want to attract more viewers from all around the globe, there are many gaming proxies available through which viewers from different countries can watch your live stream/ uploaded videos. For starters, you can try Lime Proxies, a world-class genuine proxy server with high-speed internet and fast service, 24/7 ready for service and provides a net speed of above 100 Mbps with 40+ locations.

### Step-3: Interaction with viewers

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2657" src="/assets/Twitch-Money-03.jpg" alt="make money with twitch 03" width="720" height="361" />

You cannot earn a fan base without making communication with them. There is a option of chat, near the gaming area on your screen. Make sure, you respond to your viewers request and suggestions, so that they feel included in your quest of winning the game. This particular technique can give you loyal fans and you will see, the number of loyal fans growing. So why to play games alone, when you can include your own “gaming family” in your journey.

### Step-4: Apply for Advertisements

After getting a decent amount of popularity on Twitch, you will be eligible to put ads between your games. These ads will be given to you by Twitch and the earning you made through that will be equally shared between you and Twitch. The payment will processed by Twitch to your respective PayPal account. If you place ads of any game and the viewer clicks on it, you can expect a good cut from it. Also, Twitch is owned by Amazon, so there will be many ads, directly linked to Amazon game purchase. Choose your Ads wisely, as the correct one can make you earn in thousands of dollars. (Note: If you place your ad before or between the streaming video, there is a greater probability that they will turn off or walk away. Nobody likes to get interrupted by some silly ads (not for all, but for some) in between thrilling moments during streaming videos. So, better place it at the end of the video and don’t worry, your loyal fans will stay around to watch your ad)

### Step-5: Become a Sponser

As you become more and more popular across the platform, you will be selected among the few, for sponsoring newly launched games in the market. The gaming company will offer you a good amount of money to play this game on your broadcasting channel and promote them to your viewers. (Note: you will be astonished with the number of gaming companies approaching you, so if such situation arises, hire a personal assistant for your financial handling). You don’t want to get dragged into any kind of tax dilemmas, so better hire a financial consultant to handle the accounts part. The earnings will be really high, that’s why it is suggested to takes this particular step seriously)

If you are up for it, you can ask for donation for your viewers. You just need to add alert notifications and broadcast live, so that you can show to them about the amount of donations you are getting. Try to be generous, polite and funny so that viewers will find you more as a relax personality and thus, more donations. You can also make a formal announcement about the “Donations of the day” or “The donator of the week” to acknowledge their help and support. These kind of activities will most probably prompt your viewers to donate more. You can create a special place in your channel for the donators, to make them feel special.

As the donations are made, your standing will increase in the graph. This will make your viewers attach to your goals as their own.
