<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1410" src="/assets/What-is-Google-AdWords_.png" alt="GOOGLE ADWORDS" width="720" height="360" />

Google AdWords is an <a href="/blog/how-to-skyrocket-social-media-marketing-efforts-with-proxies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advertising</a> system by Google, which provides a platform for advertisers to bid on specific keywords. As an advertiser, you have to bid for those keywords, which are most relevant to your <a href="https://www.dnfinder.com/blog/5-tips-keep-hackers-away-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> and products. Your clickable ads will appear on the search result page of the audience.

### Google AdWords comprises of two networks:

#### 1. Search Network:

The search networks contain Pay-per-View advertising. Also known as paid search, <a href="http://purplerain.in/blog/influential-ppc-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pay-per-click</a> or PPC are those ads which are displayed on the screen of a user, when he/she enter a particular keyword in Google Search Engine. To get those Keywords, an advertiser has to bid on those keywords. For Example: If a website &#8220;xyz.com&#8221; purchased the keywords “Shoes in Manhattan”, then whenever a user will search the keyword, then the ad of &#8220;xyz.com&#8221; will be displayed on the user’s search page.

#### 2. Display network:

Google Display Network has the potential to reach 90% of Global Internet Users. With Display Network, advertisers can put their visual banner-style ads on those <a href="https://www.dnfinder.com/blog/tips-tricks-host-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">websites</a> which are a part of the Display Network.

##### Setting up an account on Google AdWords:

It&#8217;s simple. You can create a Google AdWords account by using your existing <a href="/blog/gmail-stop-scanning-inboxes-free-account-holders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gmail</a> id, or you can create a new account. While creating a new AdWords Account, you have to provide your location and Time Zone. After that, you have to offer your billing details through which Google will charge you every month.

With a properly structured AdWords Account, you will get more relevant traffics and clicks. Along with that, your quality scores will also get higher, leading to lower cost-per-clicks. Though running a single ad campaign does not require any structuring, multiple campaigns on the other hand do need proper account structure.

In an ideal Structured AdWords account, each ad campaign has its ad groups. Each ad group must contain its specific keywords, ad texts, and landing pages. There are various ways to structure your Google AdWords Account. You can structure your account based on the type of your websites or the kind of products, you offer. If you provide your products and services in a different location, then you can structure your account based on <a href="http://www.limevpn.com/how-to-bypass-geo-blocking-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">geographic</a> area.

#### Search Remarketing:

No matter what option you choose, you can watch the performance level of your every audience individually. You can select a specific number of audience and apply your bid adjustments. You can control the level of exposure of ads to a particular audience with the bid adjustment option.

While remarketing audience, you can use the exclude option to remove all the converted audiences from your current search campaign. By excluding converted audience from seeing your ads you can display more ads to your target audience.

#### Display Remarketing

Google display remarketing is a creative way to target your audiences who visited your website before but left without buying the product. Through Google Display Network you can show your ads on those websites which your targeted audiences are visiting. AdWords comes with ample convenient formats for displaying your ads.

#### Responsive Ads:

These Ads include both image and texts. Both photos and text will appear on the website in multiple size and format. Depending on the type of your placement, Google may decide to show only the text or both text and the image.

#### Image Ads:

These ads come with various types of static images, HTML 5 format or animated gifs. To know about the full list of available sizes and specs, you can look at the Google’s full list.

#### Expanded Text Ads:

To display your campaigns through AdWords Editor, you can only add texts to your ads. The ads often pull logos or other images from your website. The ads can be displayed with various size placements. The ads include a blue arrow button at the below.

#### Dynamic Ads:

Dynamic Ads pull data from the Merchant Center Feed and auto-populate your ads with the name of the products, images, and pricing of the products. These ads are ideal for those audiences who viewed a particular product but didn’t purchase it. These ads can also be used for the audiences who abandoned their shopping cart.

In Search, you have to go to your audience section and add remarketing audiences’ option from your desired ad campaign. With search, you will have both the “Targeting” and “Observations” options. If you want your remarketing audiences to watch only display ads, then select the ‘Targeting” options. You can also break down your Remarketing lists and target only a specific set of customers. For that, you have to select the “Remarketing” option from “Targeting” menu.

#### Video Remarketing

Both Youtube and Google Display Network Placement allows you to display video ads to your target audience. Not only can you remarket your website audiences, but you can also remarket your video ads to all the people who watched your videos on your YouTube Channel. To display your video ads to your YouTube audiences, you have to link your AdWords account to your Youtube Channel.

When you use remarketing for video ads, you cannot use the bid adjustment function or the “Observations” functions. You can only be able to target your audiences directly.

### Types of Video Ads:

#### In-Stream:

**• Preroll: Ads that run before a video**

 **• Midroll: Ads that run in-between a video**

 **• Postroll: Ads that run after a video**

#### Video Discovery:

These ads come alongside other videos. Apart from promoting Youtube videos, these ads are also displayed in the search results of the audience.

#### Bumper:

Usually, these un-skippable ads run for 6 seconds before the real video.

### Gmail

Since November 2017, Google is providing remarketing options for Gmail Ad targeting. To create Gmail Ads, you have to use the new AdWords Interface. Even though you can run ads in the old Interface, but for editing purpose, you have to use the new Version of AdWords.

### How to create a Gmail Campaign?

First, start a new campaign and in the Campaign Type option, choose “display’. You can either choose a goal or not; it’s not mandatory. If you are picking a goal for your campaign, then select leads, Sales or Website Awareness. As a campaign subtype, now choose the “Gmail Campaign” which will be displayed next to the campaign.

While defining your campaign setting, you will have the option to add targeting. Select the Remarketing option and after that select your desired audiences from the list.

By Gmail remarketing, you can use both responsive and dynamic type of ads. Your responsive ads will be adapted to fit inside a Gmail specific placement. The dynamic ads will be displayed to an individual in a particular website.

#### Similar Audiences

Similar audiences are also known as lookalike audiences in other ad platforms. These are the users who share the same demographics and common interests, among the audiences you have created in your list. The similar audiences are auto-generated in your account based on the list of your remarketing audiences. Similar Audiences have a great potential for conversion.

You can use these audiences in your shopping, search and display campaigns. To make the similar audiences compatible with the display campaign, the list of your remarketing audiences must possess a specific level of similarities among users and must have 5000 cookies at least. As the similar audiences are auto-generated, you can rely on the work to be done by Google. If you want to use similar audiences feature in a search campaign, then your remarketing list must possess at least 1000 users along with their specific similarities features.

For the rest of audiences, you can choose a collective “targeting”, “Observations” as well as Similar Audiences. These options provide a great way to convert a wide range of users. At first, you can use the “Observations” option in your search campaigns. If that doesn’t produce any desired results, then you can apply bid modifiers.

#### Audience Exclusions

Apart from targeting audiences, you can also exclude some audiences from your ad groups. This option is helpful in removing audiences, which doesn’t show any potential to convert. Audiences whom you might consider removing are those who are previous purchasers who don’t see ads. You can also remove those audiences who are looking for something that you do not promote. For example, if your ad campaign focuses on the Industrial level of customers, then you may have to exclude all the audiences that have viewed consumer related content.

### How to Exclude Audiences:

To exclude audiences, you have to visit the Audience Section of your relevant ad group and select the “exclusions “option. A box will appear that will ask you about the type of audience you want to exclude. You can use the Plus and Minus symbol to remove and add audiences.

#### Minimum Size of Audiences:
