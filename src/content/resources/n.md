The process in which proxies work involve some intricate details that ultimately depend on the type of proxy being used. Proxies can be a forward proxy or a reverse proxy. The former is what regular internet users usually encounter, while the latter is more commonly used by the destination web servers.

Below are the most common types of forward proxies:

## 1. Anonymous proxy

The illustration we used in the previous section perfectly describes how an anonymous proxy works. They act on behalf of the end-user, making the destination web server believe that it was they who made the request when in reality, somebody else is on the other end. Anonymous proxies obviously obfuscate the end user's identity, which has increasingly become a necessity in today's zero net neutrality world.

Using an anonymous proxy will keep clients from being bombarded with targeted ads, and will also keep them safe from identity theft. This is done by discarding cookies that are injected when people visit websites which are further used to track the userâ€™s every move.

## 2. Elite proxy

Elite proxies or high anonymity proxies give utmost security and privacy for internet users as they don't come off as proxies to web servers. They constantly change the IP address they use when communicating to web servers, so they can't be detected as proxies. Other people also use proxy switchers, like in the video below:

Proxy or IP address switching is a very important feature especially since there are web servers who have developed a way to detect and block proxies. Elite proxies provide users with the ultimate disguise since the web servers have no idea that they are communicating with a proxy server. 

## 3. Transparent proxy

Transparent proxies do not hide the IP address of the end-user, which is why they are called transparent. They still come in between the user's computer and the destination web server, and all requests go through them, but only to filter the content being passed through the network, and not to anonymize the user. 

People who have used their company's internet network may have come in contact with transparent proxies since offices, schools, and libraries usually use this type of proxies to be able to control what content the end-users can access within their network. Transparent proxies provide no anonymity for the user at all. 

## 4. Distorting proxies

This type of proxy server works the same way as an anonymous proxy, although they have an additional feature that spoofs the user's real location. A distorting proxy sends a false IP address to the destination web server, making it believe that the request is from a certain location. They are usually used as tools to get around geographical restrictions. For instance, people who want to access the US Netflix libraries but are outside the country use a distorting proxy so they can obtain a US IP address and gain access to the content.

The feature that is common to all types of proxy servers is that they act on behalf of the user in requesting files or web pages from an external web server. As the middleman, proxies can filter content that comes into the network and protect the identity of the user so the destination web server will never know sent the request. The latter function, however, is absent in transparent proxies which only performs content filtering and not user identity obfuscation.

## Reverse proxies

Forward proxies are used by individuals, businesses, and organizations to connect to the millions of websites and web servers on the internet. These users know that they are connecting to a proxy server.

Reverse proxies are the opposite. The video below will let you know more about the difference between forward and reverse proxies:

Reverse proxies are mainly used by web servers as a tool to balance the load they receive and to enhance the user experience by caching static content. Reverse proxies also improve the security of web servers as they act as an additional layer that hackers have to get through before being able to reach the actual servers.

In addition, internet users won't necessarily know that it is connecting to a reverse proxy server. Websites that receive huge amounts of traffic mostly use reverse proxies though, so some internet users may already have an idea. Search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing, for example, use reverse proxies to forward the queries to the appropriate web server so it can give the user the information they need.

## Free vs. paid proxies

Most types of proxies come in two forms: public and private proxies.

Private proxies give you a dedicated IP address that you can use exclusively. This means that the bandwidth and speed of connection are all yours to enjoy. 

There are also public or free proxies that are accessible to everyone. Since hundreds or even thousands of people can be using the same server at a given time, using free proxies can slow down your connection speed. Furthermore, they are also unsafe as people with questionable intentions may also be using the same proxy server as you. You can end up getting banned even when you are not doing anything wrong. 

In fact, studies have shown that free proxy services end up very costly in terms of security and privacy as most of them log your usage and identity.
