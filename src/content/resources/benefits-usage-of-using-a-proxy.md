You might be wondering why would people need to use a proxy when all they want to do is access a web page or download files from a website. With or without a proxy, these actions can still be done. However, there are some benefits of using a proxy that people are finding very attractive. Here they are:

**1. Anonymity**: Except for transparent proxies, all other types of proxies mask the client’s real IP address and in effect, they also hide the client’s identity. This allows users to use the internet anonymously, making them relatively safe from data brokers, their ISP, and even hackers. 

**2. Caching**: Proxies cache web pages and files that have been previously requested by the client. If the client requests for the same page or file again, the proxy server will return the cached version, making connections faster and the browsing experience a lot better for the client. 

**3. Security**: When used together with an encryption protocol, proxies provide utmost security and privacy. Proxy servers alone will anonymize the connection, but it doesn’t necessarily encrypt the traffic. In effect, network traffic is still visible although tracing such traffic back to the client will be difficult. Encrypting network traffic, however, will render all traffic unreadable to anyone.

**4. Bypass restrictions**: Not every website and webpage on the internet can be accessed by everyone. Websites, corporations, and governments have imposed certain restrictions so that people in some countries won’t be able to access certain content. This is why we sometimes encounter error messages that say, “This content is not available in your location.” By using proxies, however, clients can spoof their location, making web servers believe that they are located in a country where access to the content is not restricted. 

## The many uses of proxies

Proxies have as many uses and faces as it has many types. It can be used to control and filter content while it can also be used to bypass restrictions and censorship (as in the case of distorting proxies). Proxies can be used to anonymize user IP address and identity while accessing websites, while websites can also use proxies (reverse proxies in particular) to protect themselves and balance the load of traffic they are getting.

Aside from these general types of proxies, there are even more subtypes as you delve further into the topic. Proxies also have different use cases, and the most common ones are:

**1. Ticket booking**: Ticket to events such as concerts and live sports games can be bought online through several ticketing portals. The problem with purchasing tickets through these online ticketing sites is that they limit the number of tickets that can be purchased using a single IP address. Ticketing proxies can solve this problem and allow you users to purchase as many event tickets as they like by allowing them to use hundreds of proxy servers, each with a different IP address.

**2. Gaming**: Serious gamers who have made a profession out of playing online games often use [gaming proxies for several reasons](https://limeproxies.com/blog/top-10-reasons-why-do-gamers-use-gaming-proxies/). For one, gaming proxies enable them to access geo restricted portals, allowing them to play with team members from other parts of the world. 

**3. Web scraping**: Marketers and business owners use web scraping tools to get ahead of the competition. Proxies are needed to make these tools more effective in monitoring market prices and gathering big data. 

**4. Market research**: Like almost everything else in the digital world, market research can be automated. Websites, however, are using IP blocking technologies against bots and tools that access their sites for the sole purpose of gathering data. By using proxy servers, you can conduct market research without fear of getting blocked. 

Proxies have a lot more uses, but these four are the most common and considered as the core use cases. By being able to scrape the web and conduct market research, for instance, business owners can do competitive analysis and further improve their marketing tactics, especially their SEO strategies.

Proxy servers can be used by regular internet users to buy tickets, play online games, and just browse the web under the hood of a proxy server. At the same time, proxies can be used by marketers and business owners to get ahead and succeed in whatever industry they are in.
